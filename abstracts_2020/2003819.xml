<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project advances fundamental materials research that is bioinspired, involves biological materials, and addresses synthetic materials intended for application in contact with biological systems.  The work is motivated by the observation that living materials (cells and tissues) are soft and dynamic, and provide a range of useful functions by coupling shape, internal organization and mechanical strain.  Specifically, the project seeks to advance the design of new synthetic materials that dynamically regulate their mechanical interactions with living cells (as a type of synthetic exoskeleton), thus providing new ways to instruct the behaviors of living cells or, alternatively, report on changes in the mechanical properties of cells. The initial effort is directed at the creation of reconfigurable, soft material interfaces with red blood cells, with a focus on elucidation of the complex and non-linear mechanical interactions of soft synthetic and biological materials. The approach involves a convergence of perspectives from biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics.  In the long term, the work has the potential to lead to the creation of new classes of materials that can be used to rapidly screen for those diseased states of cells which are associated with increased cell stiffness. The project will also provide outstanding opportunities to educate the next generation of STEM students and researchers, including Native American youth in the Ho-Chunk Nation and other children and parents in underserved communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the interactions of anisotropic and reconfigurable biomaterials based on chromonic liquid crystals with mammalian cells.  The research will investigate the use of chromonic liquid crystals as primitive, synthetic exoskeletal materials, with a focus on understanding the interplay of hydration, osmotic pressure and mechanical interactions with red blood cells.  These fundamental insights will inform the interpretation of measurements of the shape-response of single red blood cells dispersed in chromonic liquid crystals, providing new insights into how these novel biomaterials share strain with red blood cells. We will test the hypothesis that individual red blood cells differ in mechanical properties and exhibit distinct shape-responses in the liquid crystals. The overall approach to these challenging questions relies on close integration of experiment and modeling.  The use of liquid crystals as biomaterials to strain living cells such as red blood cells has the potential to provide new ways to rapidly identify cell-to-cell variation in the mechanical properties of single cells in a population. The numerical methods developed in this project will be broadly useful for studying complex fluid-body interactions encountered in a variety of materials-related disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of the project is to elucidate generally the deformation of soft biological cells when they are placed in an environment with nematic ordering (e.g. a liquid crystal). Of particular interest is the deformation of red blood cells, and the extent to which liquid crystals can be used to distinguish healthy red blood cells from unhealthy cells, based on the difference in material properties between the two. Mathematical means for analyzing and computing liquid crystalline (LC) configurations with arbitrary immersed bodies is a stepping stone towards the primary aim.  In the Mathematics Department of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, we developed an analytical framework from which exact LC configurations and surface stresses can be derived. In two dimensions, under the single (Frank) elastic constant approximation, the governing director angle field obeys one of the most important equations in mathematics (Laplace's equation), but with boundary conditions that are special to liquid crystals. On the surface of a body, the director angle is subject to an anchoring boundary condition which depends upon surface chemistry. The fact that the solution satisfies Laplace's equation revealed an opportunity to solve certain physical problems elegantly and exactly using classical techniques from complex analysis. Exact expressions were studied for one body and for multiple bodies.   This approach also led to the discovery of wonderful connections between LCs and classical results in fluid dynamics, including d’Alembert’s paradox and Stokes’ paradox. Another analogue which is particularly useful is akin to the Kutta condition, in which the circulation (in this case amounting to the topological defect locations) is set by the positions of sharp surface features, e.g. at a vertex, or multiple vertices of a triangular body.  The techniques developed for this research are expected to make a large impact on numerous problems related to active and deformable media in liquid crystals, whether the LC is naturally occurring, as in the case of emergent orientational order in biological systems, or synthetic. The expressions of force and torque on immersed bodies for arbitrary anchoring conditions and strength has now been reduced to the selection of a conformal map associated with boundary geometry, which is a classical problem with many numerical approaches and even easily installed computational packages, and so will open the door to many researchers to extend the products of the funded research.
