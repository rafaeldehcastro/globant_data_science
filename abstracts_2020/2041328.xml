<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[How do social characteristics of a speaker influence how listeners process their speech? There is evidence that social characteristics, like a speaker's age, gender, and so forth, can shift how listeners respond to their speech. For example, ambiguous sounding words are recognized quicker and more accurately when matched with pictures of speakers who are likely to say those words, and changing a visual cue about a speaker while keeping the audio constant can change listeners' judgments of what they heard. An unanswered question is whether social information is directly affecting perception, or if it is only affecting later decision-making. This study investigates how listeners use social cues in real-time by measuring the cues' influence on the earliest stages of speech perception. This is critical to our understanding of the role of social information during speech perception and will further develop our models of human language processing. Additionally, a more robust understanding of how social and acoustic cues interact may lead to the development of targeted therapies for certain types of language disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous work has demonstrated that social cues can directly shift categorization behavior, but the paradigms used in the majority of this work do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the specific time-course of social and acoustic cue integration. The specific time-course of this process is critical to debates over the nature of linguistic representation (episodic vs. abstract) and processing (feed-forward vs. interactive models). This study investigates the following questions: whether social cues can influence on-line perception as detected via eye-tracking during (a) a Ganong task and (b) a compensation for coarticulation task, and (c) whether social cues can induce selective adaptation effects in perception. The data from these experiments will directly address questions of the time-course of speech perception and inform debates over the representations and structures of models of speech perception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Social expectations play a role in our perceptions of each other.  In one example of this, linguists have found that social  attitudes and expectations may influence speech perception. For example, if the person you are listening to appears to be older you may perceptually interpret their speech in an 'old person' frame of reference, not expecting some features that might be found in younger speakers.  This  project discovered that the impact of social information on speech perception is not present (at least in the ways  measured here) in the earliest stages of perception.  In two studies, one measuring a phenomenon called perceptual adaptation, and one measuring compensation for coarticulation, using behavioral methods designed to tap early stages of perceptual processing, the results show strong effects of segmental linguistic/phonetic context but no impact of social identity such as gender or the apparent sexual orientation of the speaker.  This null effect for social information was found in experiments that did observe classic  effects of selective adaptation and compensation for coarticulation,  thus showing that the social impact on perception is of a different type  than these other perceptual effects.    It is likely that other cognitive tasks  in which social information warps sensory perception in some way may  also show a delayed effect of social context.  Eventually, it may be  possible to identify neural processes that  correspond to the different timescales of information incorporation  hinted at by this line of research.
