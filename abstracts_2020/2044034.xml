<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This university-community collaboration aims to advance the state-of-the-art in active and sustainable mobility for commuters.  The project seeks to use innovative ecosystems of smartphone based technologies to grow and sustain communities of bicycle commuters that ride to work together in both ad hoc and regular groups, improving mobility while working around limitations of current transit infrastructure in Los Angeles, a region ranked as having the highest commute-related worker stress levels in the nation.  This project uses smartphone-based participatory sensing, photojournaling, ad hoc group route planning, and dynamic visualizations suitable for community spaces that together help individuals overcome barriers to bike commuting, including perceived safety risks. The proposed solution works around and intends to inspire the necessarily slower changes to city infrastructure needed to address the “spatial mismatch” of housing and workplace locations, addressing the effects of that mismatch through gains in transportation “satisfaction” over the otherwise dominant lens of “efficiency.”   In this planning effort, the project team of university researchers and community organizations will work with residents, workers, employers, and service organizations to address research questions necessary to prepare a prototype implementation for our study area, including gathering information on bicycling ownership and practices, barriers to bicycling to work, costs of transportation and housing, employer support for bikeshare programs, willingness to make tradeoffs to ride in groups, existing community relationships and structures, collective identity dynamics, smartphone penetration, and the potential role of smartphone based participatory sensing technology. Results of this project will include the research agenda and evaluation metrics for a Stage 2 project that demonstrates how mobile smartphone support for group commuting by bicycle can turn a commute into a safe, productive, fulfilling and sustainable time investment, reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and directly address many of the challenges posed in the program solicitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines community-led training with a modest but innovative ecosystem of cloud-supported smartphone tools, such as privacy-preserving automatic route documentation, data-driven ad hoc group formation and planning of emergent group bike routes, facilitated digital journaling and exhibition that involves groups and the larger community in journaling their process of “becoming a bicyclist”, evolving digital self-portraits of the groups (and larger biking community) available on mobile devices and the web, and a public feed of de-identified safety and satisfaction incidents.  Critical to our approach is this use of creative expression and self-documentation to enhance feelings of identity and sustain the groups brought together by the systems we envision.  The collaboration addresses spatial mismatch by demonstrating that a cycling based approach can treat the "mismatch" “symptoms” more productively and more immediately than the underlying structural conditions and at lower cost by making bike-to-work a compelling and satisfying alternative.  Then, this experience can drive more significant infrastructural change to support biking itself and contribute to the civic conversation around better models for full commute and “first mile / last mile” public transit options in the longer term.  This project is supported by the CIVIC Innovation Challenge program Track A. Communities and Mobility: Offering Better Mobility Options to Solve the Spatial Mismatch Between Housing Affordability and Jobs through a collaboration between NSF and the Department of Energy Vehicle Transportation Office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project objective and NSF funding support were the development of a proposal for submitting to Stage 2 of CiBiC Innovation Challenge in the Communities and Mobility track. The project was successful in presenting such a proposal and being one of six projects selected and funded for the development of a co-creative prototype proving an innovative transportation solution to the special mismatch challenges experienced by the communities of Northeast Downtown Los Angeles.  Toward demonstrating the need and community interest in the proposed solution the project conducted three surveys:  1) A survey of commuting and bicycling habits of people who work and live in our study area of Chinatown, Cypress Park, Solano Canyon, Lincoln Heights, the William Mead Homes, and other neighborhoods of Northeast Downtown Los Angeles was conducted in Chinese, English, and Spanish. Six hundred and eighty six community members filled this survey. The resulting statistics strongly supported the need, interests, and potential for participation in the proposed techno-social bicycle commuting approach. Most significantly 78% of respondents in the study area answered yes or maybe to whether riding with an experienced bicyclist would help them start bicycle commuting. These responses strongly indicated the project?s pod- and mentor-based approach is responsive to a practical barrier in this community.  2) A survey of bike commuters in Los Angeles to gauge the potential interest in serving as Flow Mentors or Pod Leaders in the proposed pilot and to gather data about their experiences as commuters in LA. Among the data collected from two hundred and twenty respondents, and strongly supportive of the project Stage 2 proposal was the fact that 94% indicated an interest in helping others become part of a group bike-commuting project, and almost all said yes or maybe to whether they would spare a bit of their own commuting efficiency to increase group safety and enjoyment.  3) A more general survey of bicyclists across Los Angeles to assess broader interest in group bicycle commuting among those already riding a great majority once again indicated strong interest in bicycle commuting and a clear inclination to consider group riding as safer and likely supportive of their on engaging in such activity.  To gather data about the project's approach of a human-created commuting corridor the study area survey asked residents to indicate their home and work neighborhoods. Direct trajectories were mapped to show general direction of commutes. Preliminary analyses of the data, like this one, support that a small number of Flows can be used for the pilot, especially when considering bike-to-ride options for those with longer commutes.  LACBC conducted two small test rides with bikers of varying experience levels, recruited through its network, to increase their understanding of the bike commuting practices and preferences of community members. One ride was for novice commuters and one for experienced commuters who bike to work regularly. Each ride consisted of between five and eight participants and was supported by at least one LACBC staff member and two to three experienced riders with the type of experience that would prepare them to be a Flow Mentor. The rides were coordinated using the smartphone app RideWithGPS and were eight miles in length with a mid-point stop to allow for the qualitative interview/feedback session. The route of the ride was chosen based on the home and work locations of the participants. Qualitative interviews with the participants in these rides provided significant experiential feedback which strongly informed the FLOWs design presented in the successful CiViC stage two submission.  Through the above-mentioned community surveys and test bicycle rides the project partners increased our understanding of interest, barriers, and potential participation in proposed pilots.  Through the project development funding and activities of CiViC Stage one, the project expanded the team, refined the vision, further developed the system design, and adjusted the civic engagement process based on evidence in the literature as well as the expanded team?s experience and ideas.
