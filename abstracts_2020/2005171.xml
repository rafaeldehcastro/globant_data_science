<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Many goals motivate scientific interest in human memory. The brain's ability to create, store, and access memories helps enable vision, speech, learning, thought, and identity; understanding memory elucidates both the functions of remembering and the functions that rely on them. Injury and illness can suppress or overstimulate memory function, with extreme cases causing ailments like Alzheimer's disease and dementia on the one hand and PTSD and addiction on the other; a theory explaining how biological mechanisms create memory phenomena may help pinpoint the mechanistic changes responsible for memory failures. This project outlines a path to a fundamentally new theory for how the microscopic behavior of individual neurons generates the macroscopic phenomena of memory performance. The potential outcomes of this project can shed greater light on the understanding of human memory and the processes that influence it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to create models for brain behavior and memory phenomena and applies mathematical tools to investigate whether the brain model can generate those memory phenomena. Brain behavior is structured here as a Markov process derived from models of individual neurons, their connectivity, and stimuli. Markov processes, which capture the assumption that the past affects the future only through its effects on the present, exhibit a characteristic behavior called stochastic convergence, where the Markov process trends toward a predictable steady-state behavior over time. The memory model seeks to capture memory retrieval, formation, and storage as phenomena where the brain state converges to desired outcomes under corresponding stimuli, creates new convergence relationships through neuronal plasticity, and protects old convergence relationships from damage caused by that same plasticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, funded under the National Science Foundation's EArly-Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) program, invented and developed new mathematical tools to help us understand how the brain creates, stores, and retrieves memories.  The work built on prior results from the field of neuroscience that provide mathematical models for the behavior of individual neurons, trace the map of connections between individual neurons and the brain regions into which they are organized, and demonstrate the performance of humans on a variety of memory tasks under a wide range of settings and constraints.  The challenge addressed under the grant was to build tools that help us determine whether and how neurons that behave according to prior models and are connected in the ways described in the literature can achieve the types of memory performance observed in the experimental research literature.    Intellectual Merit:  Three central outcomes from this work are described briefly below.    The work done under this proposal developed new mathematical models of the phenomena of memory creation, storage, and retrieval.  While models of individual neurons capture how each neuron behaves in response to conditions in its environment (such as how each neuron reacts when some of the neurons that influence it "fire"), they do not describe how that behavior creates the phenomena of memory.  For example, they do not describe how we learn the names of people we meet, how the brain protects memories that it stored previously from the changes need to learn new names, or how we retrieve names that we already know.  The models created under this grant proposed new solutions to the question of how neurons work together to create, store, and retrieve memories. In order to understand whether and how the model of individual neuron behavior and the map of neuron connectivity work together to generate the phenomena of memory as captured by the newly proposed models, the work funded by this grant also developed mathematical tools for describing how the behavior of individual neurons and the networks through which they interact evolve over time in response to different stimuli.  The tools developed in this work are related to a mathematical theory that describes how certain sequences of individually unpredictable events (called "Markov chains") become more predictable when viewed over time. While the behaviors of individual neurons and networks of these neurons are not well-modeled as Markov chains, the work funded by this grant proved that they are related to Markov chains in a way that makes them similarly predictable; sequences that were found to be predictable in this way were named "Markov-adjacent" sequences.   Combining the new memory models with the new theory of Markov-adjacent sequences enabled a new understanding of how stable behavior can arise in the brain's reaction to a world characterized by seemingly endless variety and change.  This stability is critical for understanding how the macroscopic behavior of memory phenomena can arise from the microscopic behavior of individual neurons and their connections.    Broader Impact:  While the primary aim of this project was to answer the important questions of how the brain creates, stores, and retrieves memories, the results derived in this work may also have impact in a broader range of problems.  Three examples follow.    The type of stable behavior proposed in this work to be critical to the performance of memory tasks and demonstrated to arise from the brain model may also be useful for understanding other brain functions.  For example, the human brain is extremely efficient at understanding visual information. The same mathematical tools that help us understand how we can reliably retrieve memories may also help us understand how we can recognize objects we see even as viewing angles, lighting conditions, and surrounding scenery change.   The mathematical tools created to understand healthy brain function may also be useful for understanding how the brain behaves more broadly.  For example, understanding how changing the neuron model changes the full-brain behavior that arises may be helpful in understanding and tackling neuro-degenerative diseases that affect the behavior of individual neurons. Likewise, understanding how changing the connectivity map changes the full-brain behavior that arises may be helpful in understanding and tackling challenges faced after certain brain injuries.   The theory of Markov-adjancent sequences may be useful beyond the study of neuroscience.  For example, it may be useful for modeling how economic markets behave over time or how to better predict phenomena like earthquakes or weather.
