<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is to support the Workshop on New Frontiers of Thermal Transport to be held on March 9-10, 2020 in Orlando, Florida. Thermal transport processes are critical in many traditional and emerging engineering applications, ranging from energy, electronics and aerospace to manufacturing, food and health care. However, the scientific community is lacking in providing innovative thermal solutions in order to improve existing technologies or to address emerging challenges. Communications between industry and academia need to be strengthened so that the researchers can better target technology bottlenecks. This two-day workshop will bring together academicians, industry experts, researchers from national labs, and program managers from funding agencies to brainstorm and develop a shared vision and future opportunities for the community at large. Six focused panels will cover emerging challenges that will need to be resolved to enable future technological advancements. Subsequently, participants will convene in breakout sessions to explore future directions to address these roadblocks. Outcomes from these discussions will then be presented and a report will be disseminated to summarize major findings and recommend future research opportunities. This workshop will promote the societal impacts of academic research and advance the professional development opportunities for participants that are early in their career or are under-represented in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-day workshop will bring together experts from various disciplines to identify critical challenges, advancements, and new directions in thermal transport research. Six panels on energy, advanced manufacturing, thermal management, aerospace, artificial intelligence, and health and sustainability will be included. The goal is to identify key research, development, and design needs and provide a guideline for future endeavors. The outcomes of this workshop will focus on the development of a roadmap that will define the needs for future generation of thermal transport process technologies, as well as documentations in archival review articles and a dedicated website. This workshop is expected to (i) promote the societal impacts of academic research, (ii) reinforce a scientific community of university-industry researchers who are active across disciplines and (iii) advance the professional development opportunities for early-career participants. Special attention will be paid to the inclusion of under-represented minorities and women both in invited speakers and in participants. The ultimate goal is the eventual development of solutions to address current and future thermal transport challenges in a range of critical industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Engineering academics and practitioners from around the world convened at a six-day virtual workshop recently hosted by the University of Central Florida?s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and sponsored by the National Science Foundation. More than 230 people from institutions and agencies such as Cornell University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Office of Naval Research, the Department of Energy and Ozyegin University in Turkey, were in attendance. We were extremely pleased with the turnout, and every session was well attended. More importantly, the level of excitement and energy that was displayed by the participants, moderators and panelists was evident throughout the workshop. The theme of the workshop was thermal transport, or the process of heat transfer, which is prevalent in many engineering applications such as electronics, energy and manufacturing. Individuals from both academia and the industry were brought together to discuss the challenges in this area and to determine where future research should be focused. To a large extent, the heat transfer scientific community is comprised of individuals, or small groups, working in silos or at least not in a harmonious manner. We sought to better educate academicians about industrial and government needs and to help develop a loosely defined shared vision about research direction pertinent to thermal transport for the next decade or so. The event took place via Zoom over two separate weeks in December 2020 and January 2021 (Agenda below). Attendees could choose to attend all or some of the six sessions that included Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing and Data Science, Manufacturing, Energy, Thermal Management, and Health and Sustainability. These sessions started with panel discussions about the theme of the day, virtual networking and poster presentation in Gatertown ? a web based site facilitate live virtual meeting ? and breakout sessions. The last day was devoted to a panel hosting program manager, report from moderators, and discussions. All six panels were recorded and are available for viewing on the Workshop website at <a href="http://mae.ucf.edu/ucfnsf/recordings/">http://mae.ucf.edu/ucfnsf/recordings/</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Panelists included Evelyn Wang, the head of the mechanical engineering department at MIT; Karen Thole, the chair of the mechanical engineering department at Penn State; Michael Ohadi, the program director for the Department of Energy?s Advanced Research Projects Agency ? Energy; Mark Spector, a program director for the Office of Naval Research; and Howard Stone, the chair of mechanical and aerospace Engineering at Princeton University. The workshop took more than a year to produce due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was originally scheduled as an in-person event in March 2020, but was re-organized into a virtual conference by Professor Peles from the University of Central Florida, Professor Jonathan Malen from Carnegie Mellon University, and Professor Xiulin Ruan from Purdue University.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/01/2021<br>      Modified by: Yoav&nbsp;Peles</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2016434/2016434_10652332_1633117039611_AgendaDec--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2016434/2016434_10652332_1633117039611_AgendaDec--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Agenda -December"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2016434/2016434_10652332_1633117039611_AgendaDec--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Agenda -December"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Agenda for the sessions during December 2020</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yoav P Peles</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yoav&nbsp;Peles</div> <div class="imageTitle">Agenda -December</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2016434/2016434_10652332_1633117095889_AgendaJan--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2016434/2016434_10652332_1633117095889_AgendaJan--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Agenda -January"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2016434/2016434_10652332_1633117095889_AgendaJan--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Agenda -January"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Agenda for the January sessions.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yoav P Peles</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yoav&nbsp;Peles</div> <div class="imageTitle">Agenda -January</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
