<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impacts/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore technology to synchronize different sources of energy for buildings. The stakeholders include utility, independent system operators, energy analyst, building automation providers, energy aggregators, energy regulators and third-party energy providers.  The project will investigate how software predicting the efficiency and configurations of solar cell installations can improve their performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project technology is based on the development of a modified numerical weather prediction modeling system (WRF).  This system will allow designers to optimize active technologies, such as photovoltaic (PV) installations on the roofs of buildings, and passive systems such as efficiency enhancement, insulation and white roofs, to meet and minimize the electricity demand.  These technologies are developed not only to mitigate extreme loads but also to provide and forecast PV-power potential.  This system can be used on-site or at a utility to promote integration of energy sources such as solar PV, electro-thermal batteries, and micro-grids, and to optimize demand response strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Preliminary testing of this method in New York City was successful when benchmarking results with a large number of environmental sensors across the city and a few selected buildings.  This technology approach could empower buildings facilities managers to optimize their resources, allowing them to better manage manpower and resources to handle peak loads including the possibility of "getting off the grid" whenever they expect increased costs due to peak demand events.   With worldwide demand response programs increasing, the continued trend in warmer summers inducing higher demand peaks, and the rapid penetration of renewables to meet these energy demands, this I-CORPS project opened the opportunities to support stakeholders to reduce their operational costs with minimal onsite footprint.  The prospect technical solution has the ability to serve any building in any given city allowing to scale fast and with few technical barriers taking advantage of the growing need for energy management at the building level.
