<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award provides support for 15 U.S.-based students to attend The Web Conference 2020 (TheWebConf 2020), held in Taipei, Taiwan, April 20-24, 2020. The students attend the conference to present their own work, get the opportunity to learn and discuss current research topics with leaders in the field, as well as to further their career through the numerous additional events and networking opportunities provided by the conference. Events at the conference include Research track sessions, Demonstration sessions, Workshops, Tutorials, Exhibition sessions (including booths by industry sponsors), as well as events specifically geared towards students, including a PhD Symposium. As part of The Web Conferenceâ€™s wider effort to champion diversity, a particular emphasis is on the inclusion of underrepresented minority students, women, and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Web Conference (formerly known as the WWW conference) is the premier international conference on the topic of the future directions of the World Wide Web. The conference series began in 1994 at CERN. The conference brings together researchers, developers, users, as well as commercial ventures, and provides an open forum in which all opinions can be presented, subject to a strict process of peer review. The location of the conference rotates among North America, Europe, and Asia. The 2020 conference will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Web. The proceedings will be published in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library. The website for The Web Conference 2020 (https://www2020.thewebconf.org) provides additional information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Moreover, given the late shift to an online event in 2020, significant funds were left over, and, with NSF approval, the objective pivoted to providing as many students as possible with remote attendance support for The Web Conference 2021 (held on April 19-23, 2021), while also improving diversity at the event, and therefore special emphasis was placed on supporting women and underrepresented minorities.
