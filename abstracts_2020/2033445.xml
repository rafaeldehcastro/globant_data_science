<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education on all fronts with no warning. The response from universities to go online was relatively consistent among universities, but K-12 education’s transition has not been as straightforward. Existing issues of equity, access, and inclusion have required school districts, schools, and teachers to adopt a variety of solutions, including no instruction, online instruction, and shipping materials/supplies to students at home. The existing pilot cohort of Engineering for Us All (E4USA) teachers provides a unique opportunity to understand how teachers are transitioning, especially when implementing a new and innovative engineering curriculum. This project allows the multi-institution E4USA team (Virginia Tech, Arizona State University, University of Maryland, Loyola University Chicago, Morgan State University, Regent University, Towson University and Vanderbilt University) to collect data on what has happened during the unforeseen and unique transition to ensure better capture and understanding of the drivers behind decisions and changes within high schools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The E4USA Team will explore the following research questions: (1) How did the pilot year E4USA teachers adapt and deliver the curriculum during the COVID-19 disruption?; (2) What effect has COVID-19 had on the initial cohort of teachers’ motivation, self-efficacy, sense of expectancy/value, and imposter syndrome?; (3) Did E4USA student perceptions of the program change after the disruption?; (4) What effect has COVID-19 had on the potential effectiveness of the upcoming 2020 summer PD?  A multifaceted approach will be used to collect and analyze this data. Previously collected focus group transcripts and discussion posts from the pilot teacher cohort will be revisited along with post-COVID-19 focus groups and discussion posts to explore changes due to the pandemic disruption.  Focus groups will be conducted with pilot teachers, incoming teachers, and students in the E4USA class to explore how the COVID-19 disruption affected their perception of the class and of engineering. Existing survey instruments for teachers are designed to measure motivational, instructional and engagement self-efficacy. These will be modified to ask teachers to rate these items side-by-side in the context of regular classroom teaching and COVID-19 related adaptations. Existing feedback and reflection questions designed as part of the initial survey will also be modified to include adaptations related to COVID-19. Finally, we will examine course artifacts before and after the COVID disruption. This study will allow the E4USA team to develop a framework to advise and inform both internal E4USA stakeholders and external education communities. Dissemination of these findings has the potential to inform all who are developing teacher PD, those funding and researching engineering in K-12 settings, local school administrations, and other universities interested in working with K-12 schools. This unique opportunity is urgent and may be the only mechanism to truly understand how to plan for, rather than react to, future catastrophic interruptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This RAPID project was in conjunction with another, larger project called e4usa (e4usa.org), which is a high school curriculum designed to democratize engineering.  It is implemented to introduce engineering to students who may not otherwise have any exposure to engineering, including a deeper understanding of how engineering design affects humanity, the environment, and culture, along with hands-on experience in engineering design.  Since e4usa is a new and innovative curriculum, professional development was also developed and implemented.  In March 2020, during the pilot year, the COVID pandemic meant that the instruction was completely disrupted; classes went online (which was a novel technology at the time), were cancelled, or were home-based, with teachers delivering supplies to students’ homes. The effects of the COVID pandemic were extreme.  This also meant that the former, successful, in-person PD would need to be redesigned to be offered remotely. To do this effectively, we realized that we needed to understand the effects of the disruption. Specifically, we studied the effects that the COVID-related transition, and how to best design a remote PD.  We accomplished this by conducting a series of interviews with the pilot-year e4usa teachers to understand their school district reaction to COVID; what changes were made, what were the drivers behind those changes, and how did they adapt.  We further discussed necessary PD changes and their effect. Further, we conducted focus groups with our pilot teachers and the second cohort of teachers.  We found main themes emerging from teacher interviews were adaptations made in pedagogy, including communication with students, huge perceived changes in student motivation (grades and student engagement), issues in digital equity (laptops and internet access varied greatly among localities), successes (unique solutions with alternate projects) and teacher future plans.  The transition to online was a now-obvious pedagogical change. We found teacher responses and requirements varied tremendously depending on locale, ranging from "No more classes" to teachers developing and distributing kits.  Digital equity was a known phenomenon; however, students need to rely on their home technology amplified this issue. Student participation overall dropped dramatically in all aspects of K-12, with video conferencing introducing the opportunity to turn off the camera.  The new, online PD was offered in 2020 and 2021.  Changes to the PD included offering two different modalities (named ‘sprint’ and ‘marathon’) to address different time management needs of instructors.  Post-PD evaluation informed us that the marathon wasn’t particularly effective, and future offerings will be more compact.  We did successfully introduce a mix of asynchronous and synchronous content; teachers had ample time to study asynchronous content prior to meeting over video conferencing and engaging in synchronous lessons and discussion.  These lessons informed the e4usa PD, but are also applicable and useful for other programs developing PD. The changes made based on the insights collected, specifically within the e4usa project, should help build capacity within all of education when potentially facing another major disruption without warning. The result will be schools and teachers fully equipped to educate students in any situation to the benefit of tomorrow’s workforce.
