<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation-Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to ensure the safe operation of critical civil infrastructure (such as pipelines and bridges) using a more reliable and cost-effective means of monitoring their health. Subjected to an increasing number and magnitude of extreme weather events, the performance of aging infrastructure is a concern; Unexpected failures cause significant disruption in transportation and negatively influence human lives and the environment. Fortunately, acoustic emission, can “listen” for cracks in the infrastructure and detect defects before they are visible. The innovation is to build a low-cost and low-power acoustic emission device for instrumenting infrastructures with hundreds of sensors and detecting the damage initiation at the earliest state. The technology for the sensors is micro-electro-mechanical systems, MEMS. Mass manufactured MEMS acoustic emission devices may take the technology to the next level by collecting big and reliable data from infrastructures. The aim is to instrument infrastructures with voluminous sensors that can rapidly inform about the structural state and safety. When the majority of structural systems in the US are instrumented with MEMS acoustic emission devices, the initiation of failure can be detected at its earliest stage and necessary precautions can be taken, preventing greater expenses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to transition multi-frequency MEMS acoustic emission devices integrated with noise isolation capability into a field-deployable technology. Acoustic Emission is a nondestructive evaluation method based on detecting the propagating elastic waves due to active defects or movements such as crack growth or landslides. It is well-known for detecting the initiation of damage, pinpointing its location, qualitatively assessing the severity of damage, and classifying the damage mode using pattern recognition tools. However, current acoustic emission sensors are bulky, expensive, and significantly influenced by background noise; They require complex post-processing to understand the signal characterization, which delays the decision-making process. MEMS sensors are manufactured using micromachining techniques, that allow mass manufacturing with repeatable intrinsic characteristics. MEMS acoustic emission devices will be built by multiple super-narrow bandwidth MEMS piezoelectric resonators connected in an array such that the total response is amplified by the constructive interference of carefully selected frequencies. The signal can easily be decomposed into its frequencies in order to understand the frequency-dependent damage modes and severity. To distinguish artificial noise sources from active structural defects, the MEMS acoustic emission device will be coupled with broadband elastic metamaterials to block unwanted signals for the reduced-data wireless transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Unforeseen structural failures can lead to considerable mobility disruptions and adversely impact human life and the environment. Over the past decades, extensive research has been conducted on nondestructive evaluations (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques to ensure the structural integrity of infrastructures and mitigate failures. Acoustic Emission (AE) technique is based on detecting elastic waves released due to active defects. AE provides continuous, real-time data regarding the location and severity of defects in structures. AE sensors play a critical role in the effectiveness of this method. However, it is worth noting that conventional AE sensors, while highly capable, are often characterized by bulkiness and high cost. Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) involve creating small-footprint sensors using micromachining methods, enabling large-scale manufacturing with consistent and reliable properties. In this project, we developed a multi-frequency MEMS AE sensor and packaged it to match the sensitivity of traditional large sensors. The goal is to make these sensors cost-effective and deploy hundreds of them in infrastructures. This extensive sensor network helps identify the early stages of damage in structures, improving safety and maintenance practices.</p> <p>The MEMS AE sensor was built by connecting sixteen individual resonators in a parallel configuration. The resonators were designed to operate within a frequency range of 100 kHz to 700 kHz, suitable for various civil engineering applications, including composite, steel, and concrete structures. The sensor weight was reduced by ten times as compared to conventional sensors. The sensor was custom packaged using a combination of a printed circuit board and an aluminum casing to improve performance and robustness. The versatility of the MEMS AE sensor was demonstrated through unique applications, such as embedding it into concrete to detect early-stage damage and enabling single-point source localization in plates and pipes. In the context of customer discovery interviews conducted as part of the NSF I-Corps program, it was found that this miniature AE sensor holds excellent potential for enabling rapid safety and performance analysis in weight- and space-restricted applications, such as composite pressure vessels in fuel cell cars. The capabilities and impact of the MEMS AE sensor were shared and disseminated through various channels, including working group meetings, EXPO visits, conference presentations, and peer-reviewed journal manuscripts. Additionally, the project involved the active participation of three women engineers at different levels (undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctorate) and an undergraduate student, Ph.D. student, and post-doctorate scholar. One of the post-doctorate scholars engaged in the project participated in NSF regional and national I-Corps programs and received valuable entrepreneurship training. The technology readiness level of MEMS AE sensor was brought from level 4 to 7 through this PFI-TT funding.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/16/2023<br>      Modified by: Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016444/2016444_10701983_1697490463002_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016444/2016444_10701983_1697490463002_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Custom-designed MEMS package"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016444/2016444_10701983_1697490463002_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Custom-designed MEMS package"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The comparison of MEMS AE sensor with conventional AE sensor.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Didem Ozevin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Custom-designed MEMS package</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016444/2016444_10701983_1697490350435_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016444/2016444_10701983_1697490350435_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Optical image of MEMS sensor"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016444/2016444_10701983_1697490350435_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Optical image of MEMS sensor"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sixteen resonators with distinct frequencies are connected in parallel for obtaining all the frequencies with single channel.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Didem Ozevin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Optical image of MEMS sensor</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016444/2016444_10701983_1697491125506_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016444/2016444_10701983_1697491125506_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Aluminum MEMS AE Package"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016444/2016444_10701983_1697491125506_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Aluminum MEMS AE Package"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The application of MEMS AE sensor for embedding into concrete</div> <div class="imageCredit">Didem Ozevin</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Aluminum MEMS AE Package</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
