<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has had a sudden and significant impact on almost all aspects of daily life in the United States. In higher education, college teachers and students have had limited time to adapt to the new normal of online learning, while observing increasingly stringent shelter in place ordinances and coping with the stress and grief that comes with a worldwide health crisis. This project will investigate how the pandemic has impacted faculty, staff, and students in STEM education, with a particular focus on engineering. The opportunity to collect this data right now, as the crisis unfolds, underscores the need for RAPID funding. The research team will use an online data collection platform, called SenseMaker, to collect short stories from faculty, staff, and students that describe how they are experiencing the COVID-19 crisis and transition to online learning. These stories will be used to help administrators respond to challenges in real time. Data from the study will also be used as the basis for future work, which will focus on what organizational and cultural aspects of STEM higher education can help universities better prepare for future disruptions. This RAPID project will be the first time that the SenseMaker approach has been used to investigate how university programs cope in times of crisis. SenseMaker has previously been used to investigate community experiences in other crisis contexts, such as how different stakeholder groups adapted to the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico (see NSF award: 1832678). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a novel research method, SenseMaker, to capture systems-level dynamics in a College of Engineering as they emerge in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Three research questions will be investigated: i) How are students, faculty, and staff in a College of Engineering experiencing the COVID-19 crisis and associated transition to online learning? ii) What aspects of thriving (e.g., autonomy, flexibility, accountability etc.) are particularly salient to engineering faculty, staff, and student experiences? And iii) What actions can be taken to respond, in real-time, based on the SenseMaker findings, to improve the teaching and learning experiences, and general well-being of students, faculty, and staff in a college of engineering? This RAPID project will continue until 1-month after the return to face-to-face classes. Data will entail the continuous collection of micro-narratives of participantsâ€™ experiences (qualitative data) and responses to a series of survey questions that will prompt participants to make sense of their experiences (quantitative data). These data will be analyzed for patterns to inform immediate actions to improve the experiences of faculty, staff, and students in a college of engineering. These data will also inform future work that will focus on the organizational structures and cultures that contribute to resilient educational ecosystems. The outcomes of this project will include: a) a rich data set of real-time micro-narratives that capture how faculty, staff, and students in a college of engineering experienced the COVID-19 crisis and associated transition to online learning; b) a theoretically-grounded, tested, and validated methodological approach and instrument that can be deployed in times of crisis in STEM programs across the nation to collect real-time data on faculty, staff, and student experiences; and c) a preliminary understanding of what organizational structures and cultures contribute to resilient educational ecosystems and how these structures and cultures can be fostered outside of times of crisis to better prepare STEM programs for future disruptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project had two main goals. The first was to examine how students, staff, and faculty in a college of engineering experienced the early stages of the pandemic and the transition to online learning. With this information, the research team was able to provide real-time recommendations to amplify positive experiences and address negative experiences, both in the context of the college under study and for STEM colleges across the United States and beyond. The second goal of the project was to identify organizational structures and cultures that contribute to resilient educational systems. The knowledge generated in this project will enable future educational leaders and change makers to more effectively foster these structures and cultures outside of times of crisis to better prepare STEM programs for future disruptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>To achieve these goals, we used a novel research method called SenseMaker to capture systems-level dynamics in a college of engineering as they emerged in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These data included 153 short stories, with an average length of 172 words, which described how students, staff, and faculty experienced the COVID-19 crisis and transition to online learning. In addition, each participant rated their story according to 16 questions that captured quantitative data on each participant&rsquo;s experience, such as how they viewed their experience on a 5-point Likert scale of Very Negative to Very Positive.</p> <p>We collected these data at four different points in time from April to September in 2020 and produced four interim briefs. Each brief included a summary of the results and a set of recommendations designed to amplify positive experiences among students, staff, and faculty and bring awareness to and address negative experiences. These briefs were disseminated to all students, staff, faculty, and administrators in the college of engineering at the study site. Some of the results and recommendations included: Encourage instructors to incorporate more interactive, synchronous components in their courses; Shift the College&rsquo;s instructional focus from difficulty to compassion (Interim Brief #1); Opportunities exist to question the status quo in teaching and learning; Compassion is essential and flexibility is its most basic form (Interim Brief #2); Explore a more flexible approach to decision-making that provides room for students, staff, and faculty to participate in evaluating risks and deciding how to most effectively and productively structure their activities (Interim Brief #4).</p> <p>These findings were also disseminated to the broader education community through nine presentations that directly reached over 500 people, including an invited webinar for the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE). These activities enabled the recommendations to be disseminated to institutions offering engineering, other STEM, and non-STEM degree programs across the US and abroad.</p> <p>In addition to sharing timely recommendations for how to improve student, staff, and faculty experiences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, these dissemination activities also catalyzed at least three new SenseMaker projects, including a second study of how students and faculty in a college of engineering in the Midwest experienced the pandemic, a project focused on the impact of COVID-19 on rural micropolitan communities in the Midwest, and a study of consumer plastic flows in the City of Miami. These studies speak to the power of SenseMaker to efficiently and powerfully capture systems level dynamics in real time and provide insights into how to nudge these systems toward more favorable conditions.</p> <p>After completing the four interim briefs, the research team used inferential statistics and qualitative methods to conduct a secondary analysis on the first 70 stories to identify organizational structures and cultures that contribute to resilient educational systems. We found that, in the early stages of the pandemic, the majority of faculty members rated their stories positively (62%) while the majority of students rated their stories negatively (53%). Compared to students, faculty members reported greater opportunities, fewer struggles, higher levels of willingness to experiment, better treatment by people in positions of power, and more experiences of putting the needs of others before their own. Qualitatively, we identified the importance of ability and empowerment to experiment and adapt&mdash;two key facets of institutional capacity&mdash;as key factors that differentiated positive from negative experiences. We concluded that institutions need to consider how to foster ability and empowerment in faculty and how to develop faculty's ability to foster ability and empowerment in students. We termed this latter goal "metacapacity building." This concept has the potential to have a significant impact on faculty development programming and has already catalyzed a further research project in this area.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/10/2022<br>      Modified by: Nicola&nbsp;W&nbsp;Sochacka</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2028452/2028452_10663640_1654847730828_RAPIDInterimReport1(April10-19)_front_page--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2028452/2028452_10663640_1654847730828_RAPIDInterimReport1(April10-19)_front_page--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Front cover of first interim brief"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2028452/2028452_10663640_1654847730828_RAPIDInterimReport1(April10-19)_front_page--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Front cover of first interim brief"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We created and disseminated four interim briefs as part of this study.
