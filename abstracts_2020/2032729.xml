<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The robotics community needs to learn and prepare for future infectious diseases and future disasters. Understanding the role of robotics in preventing, responding to, and mitigating the consequences of pandemics could have a profound impact on the future of robotics research and convergence research in general. This understanding could identify applications where robotics are impacting, or could impact, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic disaster. Roboticists could then concentrate on those applications and gaps while the relevant agencies could have confidence in the systems. This project will guide the rapid innovation of robots for the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic and inform future convergence research on autonomous robots by creating and analyzing a database of press and social media reports on how ground and aerial robots are being used throughout the world for the response. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two novel components that distinguish it from simple data gathering and archiving and that will ensure its utility for research. One, by archiving, curating, and analyzing the comprehensive use of robots worldwide for COVID-19 response and creating a sustainable nexus permitting incorporation of new reports during the evolving pandemic and supporting additional analyses. Two, the novel cross-disciplinary framework will provide a standard set of schemas for capturing data on the use of robots for disasters.  Not only will the framework and plan of work establish how robots are being used, it is expected to use the expertsâ€™ unique domain knowledge to identify missed opportunities for application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project has documented 338 instances of robots being used in 48 countries during the initial waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; The robots were used to protect healthcare workers from unnecessary exposure, handle the surge in demand for clinical care, prevent infections, restore economic activity, and maintain individual quality of life. The instances cover the calendar year starting with the first reported robot use on Jan. 24, 2020 in a Seattle hospital. The resulting database is available to the public. The project went beyond collecting, archiving, and curating data; it conducted a comprehensive analysis. The analysis found that the use of robots spanned six sociotechnical work domains: public safety (98 instances), clinical care (85), continuity of work and education (68), laboratory and supply automation (41), quality of life (36), and non-clinical care (10). The uses within the work domains were further divided into a total of 29 different use cases representing different missions, robot work envelopes, and human-robot interaction combinations. A major surprise was that public safety had the largest number of instances, mostly drones for enforcing quarantines and disinfecting public areas such as entrances to subways. Robots for clinical care was a close second, with autonomous &nbsp;disinfection robots and telemedicine as the largest use cases. A second surprise was the relatively large use of drones (117) compared to ground robots (219), as drones are a much newer technology and should be far behind ground robots in adoption. &nbsp;The dataset also confirms a model of adoption of robotics technology for disasters. Adoption favors robots that maximize the suitability for established use cases while minimizing risk of malfunction, hidden workload costs, or unintended consequences as measured by the NASA Technical Readiness Assessment metrics. Regulations do not appear to present a major barrier but the availability of suitable robots, either in terms of lack of inventory or prohibitively high costs, does. The model suggests that in order to be prepared for future events, roboticists should i) partner with responders beforehand to understand their needs, ii) investigate how to rapidly manufacture complex, reliable robots on demand, and iii) conduct fundamental research on predicting and mitigating risk in extreme or novel environments so that users will have confidence. These results are captured in three presentations to policy groups(including the US Chamber of Commerce and International Federation of the Red Cross), five journal articles, six invited presentations to robotics or emergency management international forums and conferences, and numerous press interviews. Plus the results have been incorporated into a National Academy of Engineering/Computing Community Consortium study on robotics for future pandemics. The results serve as a foundation for guiding use-inspired research in robotics for infectious diseases as well as fundamental and convergence research. The policy-oriented results are expected to accelerate the creation of new, more capable robots as well as inform policy mechanisms for rapidly deploying robots during future pandemics and disasters. The project has contributed to a diverse STEM workforce, with the principal investigators, both women, directing two students, one of whom is a woman. Altogether, the project sets the foundation for saving lives and minimizing the economic and social consequences of pandemics and other disasters.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/29/2021<br>      Modified by: Robin&nbsp;R&nbsp;Murphy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2032729/2032729_10695321_1627595425334_23_January_2021_Taxonomy_with_Literature_Instances_COVID_Report--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2032729/2032729_10695321_1627595425334_23_January_2021_Taxonomy_with_Literature_Instances_COVID_Report--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Use of ground, aerial, and marine robots for COVID-19"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2032729/2032729_10695321_1627595425334_23_January_2021_Taxonomy_with_Literature_Instances_COVID_Report--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Use of ground, aerial, and marine robots for COVID-19"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Use of 338 ground, aerial, and marine robots for COVID-19 in 48 countries from Jan 24, 2020, to Jan 23, 2021, arranged by work domain and use cases.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robin&nbsp;R&nbsp;Murphy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Use of ground, aerial, and marine robots for COVID-19</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
