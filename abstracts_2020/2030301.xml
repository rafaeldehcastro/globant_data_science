<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an new way of imaging the entire chest and lungs, a critical capability in assisting physicians treat COVID-19 patients. Identification of COVID-19 patients with lung conditions enables accurate triage to appropriate care levels. Current imaging modalities are limited:  CT scans are limited by logistics of patient flow, re-sterilization after use, cost, and radiation risk; and conventional ultrasound cannot penetrate the full depth of lung tissue.  The proposed project will develop a portable ultrasound system for bedside low-cost, non-invasive, highly accurate imaging of the lung, delivered via remote streaming and control, for the complex logistics of COVID-19 patient care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a portable ultrasound system for bedside non-invasive, highly accurate imaging of the lung parenchyma, mediastinum, and pleura. This project will develop core transducer components for integration into ultrasound probes, creating a 2-D imaging probe using 1-D transducer arrays. These 2-D arrays could ultimately be extended into a 3-D probe with full tomographic capabilities. The project will demonstrate the capability for lung imaging with sufficient quality to distinguish COVID-19 related issues without the need for accurate positioning, alignment, or registration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant has allowed MAUI Imaging to advance the development of MAUI's MEMS-transducer based ultrasound probes suited for use with its unique ultrasound imaging technology.    MAUI's Computed Echo Tomography (CET) solution uniquely transmits and processes ultrasound enabling image capture into and around soft tissue, as well as bone, metals, plastics, and gas/air (i.e., barriers). MAUI's approach is unlike conventional phased array ultrasound and creates a new imaging tomographic views without "shadowing".  During Phase 1, MAUI Imaging demonstrated imaging into the lung without rib shadowing.  This capability is especially relevant for lung imaging and could be of use for COVID-related patient care - one amongst many applications MAUI Imaging is pursuing with its CET.  The use of MEMS-based transducers will enable MAUI Imaging to offer this new CET imaging capability with significantly improved imaging results relative to conventional ultrasound, while also offering the lower cost benefits of MEMS-transducers.  Complete electromechanical design and building of MEMS-transducer based probe prototypes was done in Phase1 which enabled the characterization of fundamental transducer behavior as well as identification of system integration issues. Wafers with improved transducer designs addressing some of the identified transducer shortcomings identified are now in fabrication at our partner MEMS wafer foundry.  The knowledge base built through this Phase 1 work also facilitates the extension of MAUI's CET technology into 3D imaging including the capability to re-beamform raw data to create views from differed points of view and depths similar to X-ray CT scans.  The impact of this work should also help the development and commercialization of the MEMS-ultrasound transducer technology that will have applications well beyond MAUI Imaging's medical imaging technology and system.
