<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Broader impacts/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of thermal imaging tools to target breast cancer screening. With future incorporation of artificial intelligence, a home screening kit is envisioned that detects breast cancer without the assistance of technicians or doctors. The large amount of data collected in the process could be used for computer analysis to further improve oncology diagnosis and treatment, saving thousands of lives. In addition, the method is painless, economical, and convenient, enabling broader screening.  In the longer term, the enhanced thermal imaging tool used for screening may be also applied to screening and monitoring of other diseases.  Other applications are far-ranging and include diagnosis of animal diseases, or improved integrated circuit inspection methods for the semiconductor industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is to explore development of the Thermal Infrared Sensitivity Enhancer (TISE), a thin film with an engineered materials structure, for thermography (use of a thermal camera to image temperature distributions).  Laboratory results show that TISE improves the temperature resolution from 40 mK to approximately 3 mK, pushing the application boundary of ambient thermography. The proposed technology enables thermal cameras to capture more temperature details.  In combination with a thermal infrared camera, the technology provides an enhanced thermography breast cancer screening method expected to offer similar sensitivity to mammography, the current standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have previously developed a thermal imaging sensitizer (TIS) technology, where phase change materials and structures were used to coat the surface of an object, to amplify the minute temperature variation of that surface into high contrast in thermal imaging using a regular thermal camera.  The TIS technology has been published (Science Advances, 6, eabd8688 (2020)) and patented, and three major applications have been proposed: healthcare (breast cancer diagnostics), microelectronics (integrated circuit defects diagnostics) and construction (building defects detection).  This I-Corps program is intended to explore the market of breast cancer diagnosis of using TIS.  During this program, we have made phone interviews on the market (patients and hospitals) and applicatability of our sensitivity enhanced thermal infrared imaging to breast cancer diagnosis. We have learned that currently the thermal infrared imaging technique is marginalized by more established techniques (e.g. CT) in personal healthcare, mostly due to its inaccuracy and resultant high rates of false positive and false negative.  Therefore, the conclusion is that a thermography based breast cancer diagnosis is very limited in market, and an entrepreneurial effort along that direction is not worthwhile at this stage.  We will consider other applications of our TIS technology, i.e., integrated circuit diagnostics, or building defects detection.
