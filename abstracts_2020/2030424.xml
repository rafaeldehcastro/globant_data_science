<AbstractNarration>The day-long Computational Structural Bioinformatics Workshop will bring together researchers and students working on a diverse set of problems including biomolecular structure representation, prediction, and alignment, biomolecule interaction and docking, and data mining and analysis of structural and genomics data. At the core of all these endeavors is the goal to establish and explore the relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function. The workshop will be held on August 30, 2020 and will coincide with the 11th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (ACM BCB). This award will support the development and dissemination of advances in computational structural bioinformatics, and will fund workshop registration for up to 20 undergraduate and graduate students who are co-authors of manuscripts or poster abstracts accepted for presentation and inclusion in the conference proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for undergraduate and graduate students, and especially students from under-represented groups in computer science and bioinformatics, to present ongoing work, and to exchange project ideas and facilitate collaborations across labs and disciplines. The workshop will include several sessions for oral presentations of accepted manuscripts, as well as two poster sessions during which students will have the opportunity to explain their projects and answer questions. A career and hot topics round table discussion will provide students the opportunity to learn from each other and discuss current research challenges and opportunities. A synopsis of the student discussion session will be disseminated to the workshop website after the conclusion of the conference. The workshop website is at https://csbw.cs.wwu.edu/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
