<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The continental margin is a major reactor of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other geochemically important material. In the coastal ocean some of this material is associated with particulate matter the movement of which depends on the resuspension and transport of sedimentary particles by waves and currents. Understanding and quantifying the physical processes that route sediments across the shelf are therefore central to accurately estimating global budgets of such geochemically important material. In the continental shelf, surface waves and coastal currents mobilize benthic sediments and cause resuspension. This creates a mixture of turbid (sediment / water) water with an effective density higher than that of pure seawater due to the weight of the sediment. The denser turbid waters tend to flow downslope, creating the so-called wave- and current-supported turbidity currents (WCSTCs), which are among the processes that route sediments from the inner to the outer shelf. WCSTC development is a relatively small-scale process that cannot be resolved by  regional-scale numerical models and their inclusion requires the development of accurate parameterizations. Recent field observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations have provided evidence that some of the assumptions in conventional conceptualization of WCSTCs perhaps do not hold, which may have significant impacts on the amount of cross-shelf particulate matter transport. In light of these observations, this effort will investigate the role of alongshore currents and sediment size distribution on WCSTCs and will develop improved parameterizations suitable for regional-scale numerical models. The latter will help in more accurately estimating geochemical budgets at both regional and global scales. In addition, this effort will provide insights on the transition of slow-moving WCSTCs to auto-suspending or self-accelerating turbidity currents which impose hazard risk to submarine infrastructure (cables, pipelines). One graduate student will be supported by this project and will receive well-balanced training in coastal processes, environmental fluid mechanics, and high-performance computing. One undergraduate student will be recruited and will receive basic training in using high-performance computing platforms, data visualization, and physical oceanography. The developed numerical models will be publicly available for  use by the scientific and engineering communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main hypothesis of this project is that along-shelf currents play a major role in massive cross-shelf transport when combined with waves. The study will be built on Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) using high-performance computers capable in simulating fine-scale processes and producing high-fidelity results. The simulations will focus on assessing the role of sediment settling velocity on sediment concentration inside the wave boundary layer. Also, the non-linear interaction between waves, currents and WCSTCs downslope velocity will be assessed.  The simulation data will be used to develop WCSTCsâ€™ parameterizations in regional-scale models. The intellectual merits include the quantification of cross-shelf particulate matter transport that is based on physically consistent conceptualization, identifying the key parameters that affect WCSTC dynamics, and data synthesis to provide better parameterization of WCSTCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
