<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic simultaneously unleashed health and economic threats on American society, each of which produces anxiety. Ultimately, recovery will require reintegration into the social and economic fabric after periods defined by quarantine and social distancing measures aimed at mitigating the spread of the virus. To what extent will experiences of anxiety in the face of these threats curb downstream recovery? The objective of this project is to understand experiences of anxiety and recovery among a representative sample of adults in Louisiana, a coronavirus hotspot whose COVID-19 mortality rate is one of the deadliest in the nation. The proposed study will also offer guidance to governing officials in how anxiety inhibits economic and health recovery even as the experiences of threat change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To measure the durability of anxiety and its effects on social trust and engagement, data will be collected in a four-wave representative panel of adult Louisiana residents using YouGov. The investigators will measure respondentsâ€™ exposure to the health and economic threats and their anxiety over them, as well as outcome variables including perceptions of progress of recovery; trust in institutions, leaders, and residents of their communities; civic, social, and economic activity; and support for policies aimed at mitigating threat impact or reopening the economy. The major contribution of this study will be to extend the scope of analysis from the immediate, short-run effects of anxiety to the long-run patterns by which anxiety persists and has downstream consequences for social and economic engagement, as well as deepen our understanding individual differences in how anxiety is associated with social and economic judgments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Accountable Institutions and Behavior (AIB) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

We found that personal experience of health risks (e.g., testing positive for COVID-19 or knowing someone who died from the disease) and economic (risks losing income or living with someone who lost their job) produced more anxiety than did community-wide experiences (e.g., the number of cases in a community or the amount of local unemployment). Furthermore, these feelings persisted even after threats faded. In other words, once people directly experienced a negative event, they remained worried about the health or economic risks of the pandemic for a much longer period. Addiotnally, feeling anxious about the pandemic tended to curb willingness to engage in social activities (such as attending religious services, attending public meetings of government officials, or voting in-person) and boost support for policies aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19 or defraying its economic effects on people and businesses. In some cases, these effects marked long-term shifts that outlasted the feelings of anxiety that initially caused them. Finally, the results show that initially, many people saw the pandemic&rsquo;s effects as isolated on particular demographic groups, particularly the elderly, Black people, and people living in urban areas.
