<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The "Internet of Things" (IoT) describes the idea that the ordinary objects in our environment (e.g. buildings, streets, cars, refrigerators, packages, clothing, food, even pets) are equipped with small electronics capable of performing data collection, analysis, communication, and autonomous operation.  However programming literally everything requires new design principles, new software architectures, and new security mechanisms that make it possible to unify and simplify the development of IoT.  The vast array of different embedded devices, computers, networks, and storage media must be made to work together by the software they support.  Unfortunately, existing software systems require a similarly complex and heterogeneous amalgamation of technologies, making IoT software development for them very difficult and error prone.   This planning project will pursue a technology-enabled integration of new software abstractions, tool chains, hardware specialization, programming and deployment support, verification and security advances, and program portability infrastructure that together tame this heterogeneity, complexity, and scale that today is impeding IoT innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By simplifying software engineering and deployment for IoT, this project will broaden participation in innovation and enable development of new applications that extend human perception and control of the physical world through digital infrastructure.  In the same way that Internet search has made it easier for people to "remember" information, essentially enhancing human memory, IoT has perhaps greater potential to revolutionize society by enhancing human perception and control over everything people encounter in their day-to-day lives.  To facilitate this next "digital quantum leap" for society, this project will develop research prototypes, system design artifacts, and educational and outreach activities, and establish new multidisciplinary collaborations that guide and inform the research.  To ensure that the results are immediately useful to developers and researchers across disciplines, the project will also use "real-world" IoT testbeds and applications from a number of scientific domains (e.g. agriculture, astronomy, and physics) for end-to-end validation, evaluation, and demonstration of the research potential and impact. Finally, it will accelerate this impact by making all of its digital artifacts -- its design technologies and its software -- freely available as open source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With this planning grant, our research collaboration has laid the groundwork for new cross-disciplinary computing systems research, embodied in an integrated and unifying end-to-end, distributed integration platform -- called Thingularity -- that makes applications easier to develop and deploy, secure, and portable across the heterogeneity of resources that make up The Internet of Things (IoT).  The result, we believe, will enable IoT innovation to become broadly practiced rather than solely the domain of distributed and embedded systems experts.  Such democratization is key to realizing the positive societal transformation and shared economic impact that IoT promises is possible.   Using Thingularity, we have investigated new, full stack system advances, a set of system design principles, the empirical evidence of the potential of our approach, and a distributed system and testing architecture.  This planning project has enabled us to investigate this research in the context of digital agriculture and to apply and guide our scientific advances using this application science driver for Thingularity. Doing so has enabled us to develop the foundation for sustainable, reproducible, and extensible approaches that can be used to engineer highly performant, scalable, and robust computing applications that run over heterogeneous IoT deployments.   In summary, with this project, our team has  built collaborations and communication pathways among team members; worked with applications experts to understand their distributed applications and programming pain points and challenges (so that we can better target our research foci). We have also identified a subset of applications/domains to target that facilitate both scalable, end-to-end systems deployment and proves out the generality of our research contributions.  Our software tooling, prototype system, and agricultural deployment will demonstrate potential outcomes and serve as an exemplar for these explorations; constructed a comprehensive design document that our team uses to keep our research focused and our team accountable; and developed early integrated prototypes and simulations of multiple research foci artifacts across the system stack that use Thingularity as a fundamental research, integration, and demonstration instrument.
