<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project advances reproducibility in multi-messenger astrophysics by developing and sharing sustainable knowledge necessary to understand and use published scientific results. Specifically, the project targets breakthrough findings published by the First M87 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) projects. Understanding how reproducibility is incorporated in astrophysics workflows and sharing practices in reproducible scientific software help enable open science across disciplines. Codes, data, and workflows generated by this project enable researchers and students at various levels of education to regenerate the same findings, learn about the scientific methods, and engage in new science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides the astrophysics community with a transformative building block to a roadmap for reproducible open science. Findings about the reproducibility process of the EHT and NICER results are captured and disseminated through documentation, data products, and methods used. Through new insights described in publications, the project delivers recommendations on how results in astrophysics can be effectively enhanced to provide reproducible, replicable, and shareable scientific discovery. The project findings enable scientists to reproduce published results beyond the targeted work and make the methods visible to a larger audience including STEM students; the new understating helps accelerate the pace of scientific discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Developing reproducible analyses is a challenging aspect of scientific research. Few real-world studies have been performed to guide the necessary processes and products, especially in domains relying on scientific computing. The availability of data, software, platforms, and documentation limits their reproducibility. Consequently, despite a group's best efforts, other scientists attempting to reproduce an analysis may find the necessary information incomplete.    This interdisciplinary effort develops and shares sustainable knowledge necessary to understand, reproduce, and reuse the published scientific results of one NSF and one NASA funded project: the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project's analysis of the black hole in the center of the M87 galaxy and NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER).    Unlike our previous reproduction of Advanced LIGO's observations, none of the participants in this project was involved in the original EHT or NICER analysis. Thus, our work builds exclusively on the several articles describing the projectsâ€™ workflows, data, and software that are available online.    Each paper presenting results from the EHT and NICER projects outlines specific aspects of scientific discovery, but a comprehensive approach, including documentation, software, and environment to reproduce the published results of those projects, was still missing when we started this project. To this end, our work follows rigorous reproducibility directions and expands preliminary work.   As part of our contributions, we investigate the availability and integrity of the data used to recreate the images of the M87 black hole measurements of the mass and radius of the neutron star J0030+0451 with NICER. For the EHT we model the image processing workflow and study its limitations regarding software availability, dependencies, configuration, portability, and documentation. We perform a similar analysis for the NICER data analysis pipeline, and demonstrate that in addition to reproducing the work, we can extend the analysis by changing the analysis parameter and exploring new configurations.,    We rebuild the workflowsâ€™ software stack to reproduce the outcomes of the two projects; we use the software stack to analyze discrepancies between the original and reproduced results. We document each step in the process, starting from a systematic assessment of data, software, and documentation availability. We deliver a collection of fully documented containers for data validation and image reconstruction. Finally, we compile guidelines to increase the reproducibility of computational workflows in scientific projects.    Our work enhances the reproducibility and reach of scientific projects like the EHT and NICER projects, and facilitates the engagement of the overall scientific community, including postdocs and students, regardless of the domain.
