<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a new method for children with language-based learning disabilities (dyslexia) to practice early literacy skills via a spatial computing system (augmented reality).  Approximately fifteen percent of children and adults have dyslexia, a language-based learning disability that makes it difficult to read, write, and spell.  It is not related to capability nor effort.  Moreover, behavioral improvements occur among children with developmental dyslexia after reading intervention. Conventional remediation therapies include systematic phonics-based instruction or a highly trained speech-language therapist. Computerized therapies offer more intensive instruction at lower costs, but existing programs do not fully address the social-emotional anxieties seen among children with language-based learning disabilities. The proposed project develops personalized, automated interaction in a context of compelling game play, utilizing advanced understanding of learning methods and linguistic development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is based on the development of a multi-sensory learning loop within a spatial computing system (augmented reality) for end-users (children) to practice the structured literacy approach on mobile devices. Informed by research suggesting that playing 3D-platform video games promotes hippocampal health in young adults, the proposed project uses three-dimensional game objects and touch inputs from the user to stimulate motivation and learning within a spatial computing system. Linguistic principles, such as English phonology-phonics, morphology, grammar rules, and syntax are transformed into 3D game objects and embedded within a virtual simulation model wherein a user interacts with them, providing a new method to practice early literacy skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Novelty Films is an exciting education technology startup that is reimagining the way children with language-based disabilities (ages 7-12) practice IEP goals using narrative and game-based learning methodologies. By creating character-driven game mechanics and story-driven puzzles, players embark on journeys that transform learning goals into meaningful quests, which incentivizes exploration, problem solving and avatar development. During phase I, the startup team proved the technical feasibility of its work plan by applying key insights from the beat-the-odds bootcamp into designing prototypes for user testing and validation. The results from these experiments validated the team's hypotheses and shaped the product's strategy towards commercialization and societal impact.</p> <p>The problem Novelty Films solved for its customer segment was transforming the 5 domains of English linguistics into a meaningful game mechanic (core learning loop) that intrinsically motivates the child (player) to practice phonological awareness IEP goals via its game-based learning management system (GB-LMS). Phonics is the name for the process of matching letters to sounds and is essential for developing strong literacy skills. Children with dyslexia have a hard time with phonics and need to learn it in a slow, structured way. What Novelty has developed helps kids move from simple patterns of letters and sounds to more complicated ones through meaningful gameplay. Using the principles of English linguistics as a guideline, the team engineered a core learning loop that focuses on empowerment and helping the child (player) get better at something they care about. The core loop has several parts: 1) a repeatable, pleasurable activity with internal triggers, 2) feedback that drives learning and skill-building and 3) progression and investment with reengagement triggers.</p> <p>Using empathy as the focal point, the team was able to de-risk this innovation after applying key insights into constructing an early adopter community. The team recruited and interviewed a cohort of parents who were driven by the need to alleviate their child's pain points. They provided Novelty with a reservoir of insights about their functional, social and emotional needs. Based on these insights, we were able to design concept scenario prototypes to serve as springboards and test potential ideas. When playtesting de-contextualized core mechanics, storyboards aid the team to gauge their mental models, emotions and expectations. This process helped to envision how this solution might fit into their daily habits and routines.&nbsp;By understanding the relevance of their habits, the team could focus on building systems to complement a long-term relationship and add value to their time.</p> <p>Once this position was established, the team applied self-determination theory (SDT) as a means to conceptualize a quest design structure in helping the child (players) make progress. In quest design, the goal is to provide the player with a symbolic objective and a reward system that encourages progression through a role playing experience. This reward structure serves as a stimulus to guide their motivation and willingness to fulfill this mission. Self-determination theory became one of the key tools to bridge the psychological and emotional gap of the playtester's needs to the affordance of the system's core mechanics. Self-Determination theory breaks down what drives people to act a certain way or their willingness to perform a given task. SDT works to address three common, intrinsic needs: autonomy, competence and relatedness. According to SDT, when these needs are met, then people will develop optimally and inherit their potential. The primary challenge the team encountered was the lack of SDT to contextualize the core learning loop. Playtesters didn't have clear objectives nor meaningful tasks to motivate their&nbsp;actions and behaviors in relation to the principles of linguistics. Although the core learning loop was technically feasible, there wasn't a meaningful purpose behind it. To resolve this problem, the team embedded SDT into the concept scenario prototypes to communicate the relevancy of the technical output. This process helped players constructed their mental models and emotional engagement around the context, player-characters, and conflict of the proposed GB-LMS.</p> <p>Our Phase I project had the following main achievements and key outcomes:</p> <p>1. The core learning loop proved to be technically feasible by engaging and motivating children (players) to interact with linguistic puzzles in a virtual possibility space.</p> <p>2. The core learning loop proved to be technically feasible by enabling children (players) to practice contextualized phonological awareness and phonics skills using the speech function and feedback system of the Unreal/Unity game engines.</p> <p>3. The team leveraged 3D modeling software, such as Blender to create a unique, compelling and immersive virtual possibility spaces for children (players) to explore and excercise their academic understanding using our narrative-based methodology.</p> <p>4. The team established an early adopter community who are highly engaged and motivated to help their child make progress.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/02/2023<br>      Modified by:
