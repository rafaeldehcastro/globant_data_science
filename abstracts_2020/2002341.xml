<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Mobile money is a fast growing global phenomenon with $1.3 billion processed daily, nearly 1 billion registered users, and explosive 20% year-on-year global growth.  In this system, credit is offered through online platforms—often unregulated— and distributed via mobile money. In economies where exchange leans heavily on close social ties, such impersonal and socially invisible sources of digital credit represent a radical break with the bases of social order. How should we understand this juncture of digital financial circuits with household economies? How do individuals come to adopt, avoid, or use digital credit amidst a dense network of socially negotiated economic relations? And, in turn, how does the introduction of technocratic relations of debt and credit reshape existing social and economic relations? This technological expansion is often framed in terms of democratized access to the global economy, and is supported by research that examines the effect of financial-technology interventions on standard economic measures such as income. While empirically valuable, such research neglects questions of how mundane technological interventions may have broader social and political consequences. This project examines how new digital infrastructures: 1) present occasions to re-arrange existing relations of exchange and negotiation in the market; and 2) enable or constrain processes of valuation, and therefore value creation, in the market. This process-oriented approach sheds light not only on current developments but also on what a technologically-mediated economic future may look like. In the way that 20th century road infrastructure still shapes collective life, how digital financial infrastructures are laid down today is likely to have far-reaching consequences. This project presents an early opportunity to examine such futures, thus providing guidance for policy-makers looking to help societies adapt to this important technological change.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the case of changing relations of personal credit and debt amidst a booming digital market for household and personal finance. The project adopts a mixed methods approach using nationally representative survey data, qualitative interviews, and ethnographic observation in sequence to: 1) establish statistical findings about the current state of the digital economy, 2) examine how cultural narratives frame the deployment and adoption of digital finance, and 3) offer a processual account of how digital finance infrastructure re-orders exchange in everyday life. In partnership with local research organizations, the project first collects both self-reported data on social and economic behavior as well as digital trace data such as mobile money transaction logs from a nationally representative sample of 1,800 smartphone users. The project uses regression analysis and computational cluster analysis to identify key axes of variation along which the use of digital finance is patterned. The project then conducts up to 100 semi-structured interviews with developers and users of the new economy to examine how different cultural narratives and practices shape how digital finance is both designed and integrated into everyday life. Finally, the project conducts ethnographic observations in key urban and peri-urban sites to gather the evidence of people’s lives.  Findings from the project will contribute to sociological theories regarding the operation of financial markets and the effects of technological change on exchange relationships within the context of a changing global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Drawing on 24 months of fieldwork and blending multi-sited ethnography, interviews, original survey data, and analysis of large-scale platform log data, this research project examines the transformation of food markets in East Africa as institutional imperatives of "data for sustainable development" take hold. Taking the case of the platformization of agricultural value chains in Kenya’s "Silicon Savannah," I document in ethnographic detail how identity, interaction, and understandings of value in market communities are transformed as market governance is unbound from interpersonal networks and embedded in data-driven algorithmic systems&mdash; a process I call "making markets machine-readable." Original survey data matched to interview data and analysis of large-scale platform data further assess the scope of these transformations and their links to organizational and social inequality. I explore implications for financialization of local food markets, upstream agrarian change, and the character of market communities amidst globalization.    This research establishes three core findings.    1)    First, in conducting a close examination of extant fresh produce value chains, I argue that widespread informal economic arrangements, despite being characterized as chaotic, fragmented, and inefficient, in fact help traders manage uncertainties endemic to the fresh produce value chain. Analyzing over 400 hours of market ethnography and sequential interviews with wholesalers in four markets, I show how traders employ extensive interactional and relational work to cultivate stable credit, supply, and consumer networks amidst shifting conditions of price, quality, liquidity, and institutional governance. Such negotiated interactions and relations ensure the distribution of fresh food across Nairobi and moreover define value and forge the social bonds of market community. This finding contributes to research on governance of complex systems and may offer insights for the design of resilient market systems.    2)    I reveal the practical tactics through which data-driven firms transform their market environments and render them machine-readable. This empirical work draws on organizational ethnography and 72 interviews with platform technologists, developers, managers, financiers, and field agents. First, I argue that the extensive negotiations and interactional work that help informal traders "see" the market and manage uncertainty in fact renders exchange illegible to platforms. To translate complex value chain interactions into organizationally useful data, I show how technology firms work to simplify, standardize, and atomize otherwise thickly social market relations. In place of a vernacular market order, platforms assemble what I term an algorithmic market order. This process, I argue, is shaped heavily by techniques and technologies of identification, measurement, and valuation. This finding inverts our typical understanding of market change in the data economy. Instead of showing how the use of data produces the social order, I show how the social is ordered to produce and govern with data.   3)    Finally, I examine how platforms, in their search for scale, create pressures to corporatize the food system while generating new patterns of social inequality. This study juxtaposes interviews of platform technologists with a stratified sample of 42 interviews of farmers and retailers to show how exchange relations between platforms and farmers/retailers are sustained or broken. I find that platforms prefer working with larger organizations, while smaller farms and retailers often have different interactional, organizational, and temporal needs that algorithmically-bound platforms do not well afford.

This research also helped develop institutional connections between American researchers and research and policy institutions operating in East Africa such as: Financial Sector Deepening Kenya, the British Institute in Eastern Africa, and the World Bank. I plan to further cultivate these relationships as I disseminate research findings and translate academic research into policy-relevant outputs.
