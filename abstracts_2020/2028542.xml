<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Non-Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;The current COVID-19 pandemic has identified key problems in the US strategic preparedness for a national biological disaster. One of those is a shortage of N95 respirators, which provide critical protection to medical personnel as they treat infected patients. This issue is a direct consequence of the one-time-use nature of these N95 respirators; polymer fiber filters, including N95 and HEPA filters, capture and accumulate live pathogens, and so become biohazardous. In the proposed work, metallic nanowire bird’s nests and electrospun fibers are presented as approaches to resolve these problems, resulting in an improved respirator. The porous metallic nanowire bird’s nests allow air to pass through, similar to a polymer fiber filter, but the metallic surfaces possess antibacterial and antiviral qualities. As a consequence, pathogens captured in the bird’s nest are inactivated, improving the protection to medical workers and prolonging the usefulness of the respirator. The same metallic nanowires will also be integrated into a free surface electrospinning device, resulting in polymer fibers which are hairy with the antibacterial/antiviral nanowires. Electrospun respirators can be melted down in-house and re-spun into new respirators. This recycling step allows for respirators to be continuously re-used, removing the need to constantly re-stock. These efforts together may resolve the shortages of respirators in the current pandemic and present a superior filter product with bioactive components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;This work seeks to develop reusable, bioactive filter materials for N95 respirators. Current filter materials are one-time-use and accumulate live pathogens, making them intrinsically unsanitary. We propose to respond to these problems using two approaches. In the first approach, freeze-cast metallic nanowire bird’s nests will be prepared using Ag and Cu nanowires. The porous structure of the bird’s nest allows air to pass, similar to a traditional filter, while Ag and Cu have been shown to have antibacterial and antiviral qualities as nanoparticles. Nanowires may present higher efficacy against pathogens due to their ability to puncture the cell and viral membranes. In the second approach, electrospun polypropylene fiber mats will be prepared as an alternative to traditional air-blown polymer filters. The electrospun textiles can be grown to custom fit operator’s faces providing an exceptional seal for use as a respirator. Used respirators can be melted on-site (melting temperature 210-280 °C) and re-spun, to prepare new, sanitary respirators. Incorporating nanowires into the molten polypropylene will result in polymer fibers with fine metallic nanowire hairs. As before, the metallic nanowires will confer antibacterial and antiviral qualities. The efficacy of the bird’s nest, the electrospun filter, and hybrid textile will be rapidly tested using suspensions and aerosols of bacteria and bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis will serve as non-pathogenic surrogates for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, respectively. An enveloped bacteriophage in family Cystoviridae will serve as a non-pathogenic surrogate of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed research will investigate the feasibility of nanowires as antibacterial and antiviral agents, develop a new, nanostructured filter material, and explore an alternative fabrication methodology, resulting in new materials and techniques with direct consequences to the US preparedness for biological disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was developed in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the overall goal of developing scientific understanding which could be leveraged to create deployable technologies. Our research team chose to focus on filter materials; at the time, global supply chain issued caused shortages in these critical medical devices. Our approach was to develop materials which are self-sanitizing, increasing the lifetime of the respirator, and to develop a technology which decentralizes mask production. In the first set of experiments, we used freeze-dried clusters of copper nanowires as a self-sanitizing filter. Copper is a well-known antimicrobial agent, with activity against viruses and bacteria. By freeze drying high-density slurries of Cu nanowires, we created a highly porous material which can act as a filter and is self-sanitizing. Bioactivity testing was performed using four microorganisms as surrogate pathogens for enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, and gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. These tests confirmed that the Cu nanowire structure rapidly inactivated or killed our surrogate pathogens. Work then shifted to the decentralization of respirator production. Commercial respirators are prepared using melt-blowing, a technique which uses high-speed air to draw liquid polymer through microcapillaries; this technique cannot be scaled for broader deployment. We used electrospinning as a scalable alternative to prepare filter materials. In this technique, liquid polymer is drawn to form narrow fibers using high voltages applied to needles placed in the polymer. The fibers form a non-woven textile as they solidify. We prepared textiles using polypropylene (PP) to be consistent with commercially available N95 filter materials, and because PP is recyclable #4. Utilizing feed stock from an existing waste stream which is widely available improves the deployability. Indeed, non-woven textiles with a structure similar to the N95 respirator were prepared by this method. To achieve a self-sanitizing quality, Cu nanowires were integrated into the liquid plastic. As the plastic was drawn into fibers, the nanowires protruded from the surface, providing exposure for captured pathogens and bestowing the sanitizing properties. Bioactivity testing confirmed that these composite materials were able to inactivate or kill the four surrogate pathogens. While the filter material was being prepared, the bioactivity team tested candidate alloy surfaces for benchmark bioactivity. The results of this work showed mild synergistic activity and has resulted in one manuscript, currently under consideration.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/12/2022<br>      Modified by: Dustin&nbsp;A&nbsp;Gilbert</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
