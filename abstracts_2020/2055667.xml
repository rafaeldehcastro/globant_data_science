<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The jet stream over the North Pacific exerts a controlling influence on the procession of winter storms that cross the ocean to make landfall on the US and Canadian coasts.  The role of the jet as a conveyor of storms makes it a topic of interest for weather forecasters as the paths and intensities of the storms are sensitive to the various forms of jet variability including extension, retraction and north-south meandering.  Perhaps more importantly, jet variations can affect a succession of storms, so the influence of jet fluctuations extends beyond the typical five-day forecast and into the domain of subseasonal prediction.  But the underlying dynamics of Pacific jet variations are not well understood and fundamental questions remain as to the mechanisms involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pacific sector is unusual in its combination of middle-latitude jet dynamics, featuring the interplay between the jet and the weather patterns that move along it, and low-latitude influences from the region of deep convection over the warm waters of the western Pacfic.  In earlier work one of the Principal Investigators (PIs) used a Linear Inverse Model (LIM) to identify a mechanism through which tropical influences interact with middle-latitude dynamics to produce upper-level circulation anomalies.  In the present work the LIM analysis is applied to understand jet fluctuations identified using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs).  The work focuses on the dynamics of transitions from one jet state to another and the consequences of the transitions for downstream weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given its connection to North American weather and relevance to long-range forecasting, as noted above. In addition, the PIs engage in public outreach including a monthly show on Wisconsin Public Radio.  The project also provides support and training for two graduate students and two undergraduate summer interns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
