<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project concerns research in number theory to study certain properties of equations in the whole numbers. The research aims to use sophisticated modern methods in algebraic geometry and number theory to produce general bounds on the number of solutions to certain Diophantine equations.  The study of Diophantine equations involves finding whole number solutions to polynomial equalities, such as when the sum of two fifth powers is again a fifth power. The study of such equations dates back almost 2,000 years and is among the most difficult problems in all of mathematics, as evidenced by the fact that it was established only 45 years ago that it is not possible to devise a general process with a finite number of operations that can decide whether a Diophantine equation has a solution.  The bounds under development in this research project, which depend only on the degree of the equation (i.e., the size of the exponents), will advance knowledge in this fundamental area of mathematics. The project also involves a middle- and high-school enrichment program, in addition to support for undergraduate and graduate education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the investigator seeks to use p-adic analysis and the Chabauty-Coleman method, along with ideas from tropical and non-Archimedean geometry, to give uniform bounds (in terms of the genus) on the number of rational points on hyperbolic curves satisfying certain conditions, refining earlier results. These conditions generally involve a constraint on the Mordell-Weil rank. Using related methods, he will also attempt to prove the uniform Manin--Mumford conjecture, which gives a uniform bound (again in terms of the genus) on the size of a torsion packet on a hyperbolic curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Ideally this result would be unconditional; as a first step, the principal investigator will treat Mumford curves and curves with compact-type reduction.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project in question addresses a fundamental kind of question in mathematics:namely, to classify all whole-number solutions of a given polynomial equation.This question dates to the classical era, and is known as Diophantine geometryin honor of the Alexandrian mathematician Diophantus.  It is known that there isno algorithm capable of solving this question for a general polynomial (this isMatiyasevich's theorem, which resolved Hilbert's 10th problem), so finding aprovably complete set of solutions of a new class of Diophantine equations is asignificant achievement in number theory.  The goal of the present project was to bound the number of potential solutionsof certain polynomial equations, based on recent work of the PI and hiscollaborators.  The precise statement is known as the Uniform Manin--Mumfordconjecture.  This approach did not turn out to be productive, but it did lead tosome interesting mathematics.  In an effort to prove the Uniform Manin--Mumfordconjecture for curves with so-called compact-type reduction, the PI andcollaborators wrote two preprints.  In the first, we show that a map from avariety to an abelian scheme extends to any log-regular model of the variety,thus showing that an abelian scheme is a "log-Neron model" of its generic fiber.In the second, we consider an aspect of differential algebra modulo a primenumber p in which the "derivative" is replaced by a "p-derivative"; this paperwas cited in important work by Saito in 2020.  Finally, the PI and hiscollaborators have been undertaking a long-term project of developing thefoundations of a theory of real-valued differential forms on non-Archimedeananalytic spaces, with an eye to Arakelov theory.
