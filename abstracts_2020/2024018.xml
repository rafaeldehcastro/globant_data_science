<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Polar Research Board (PRB) of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine serves as the U.S. National Committee to two international organizations: the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).   SCAR helps advance Antarctic research by implementing new research initiatives, identifying emerging scientific themes, promoting international cooperation and partnerships, and providing scientific advice to the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty on issues related to the management and protection of the Antarctic region and the Southern Ocean.   IASC encourages and facilitates international cooperation in Arctic research, provides scientific input to the Arctic Council and other international policy organizations, and helps support international science development, including numerous opportunities for early career researchers.  U.S. annual dues for these organizations provides a foundation for advancing opportunities and interests of the U.S. polar research community, and for assuring continued progress in international-level research and assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)  are unique organizations that provide opportunities for U.S. scientists to develop research partnerships with polar science colleagues in other countries around the world.   IASC’s efforts to facilitate international cooperation in Arctic research are advanced through activities such as: the annual Arctic Science Summit Week gatherings; the individual and cross-cutting initiatives of IASC’s Working Groups (Atmosphere, Cryosphere, Marine, Social and Human, Terrestrial); the Arctic Data Committee and Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks; and the IASC Fellowship Program, which helps early career researchers get involved in workshops, science planning activities and research programs.   SCAR’s efforts to promote international scientific cooperation in Antarctica are advanced through activities such as the biennial business meetings and Open Science Conference; the SCAR Biology Symposium and Antarctic Earth Sciences Symposia; the SCAR Early Career Fellowship and Visiting Professor programs;  the program planning efforts of SCAR's Scientific Groups (Geosciences, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences); and the Scientific Research Programmes that are the main focus of SCAR’s international scientific coordination.   These SCAR and IASC activities help early career scientists expand research interests and develop professional connections; they help ensure that important policy decisions about managing and protecting the polar regions are based on sound scientific assessment; and they help advance scientific objectives that would be impossible for single investigators, programs, or countries to do alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Polar Research Board (PRB) of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine serves as the U.S. National Committee to two international nongovernmental polar science organizations: the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). U.S. annual dues support provided by the National Science Foundation is critical for assuring the continued operations of these organizations.   INTELLECTUAL MERIT. IASC encourages and facilitates cooperation in all aspects of Arctic research, across all countries engaged in Arctic science. They support leading-edge multi-disciplinary research, to foster a greater scientific understanding of the Arctic region and its role in the Earth system. SCAR similarly aims to initiate, promote, and coordinate scientific research among all countries doing research in Antarctica, to address compelling topics and emerging frontiers in Antarctic science. Both SCAR and IASC provide fora for international coordination, bringing together investigators from different countries and different disciplines to engage in collaborative research activities, and thus enabling research that would not be possible working solely through a single country.  Both organizations encourage and support early career scientists to participate in conferences, meeting, and research planning and implementation efforts--thus building valuable experiences and personal networks that will help advance their careers. SCAR and IASC also both encourage scientific excellence through a variety of recognition activities such as fellowships, medals and, awards.  BROADER IMPACTS.  SCAR and IASC help assure that polar science continues to advance and provide insights and information that benefit society. For instance, polar research allows us to observe the impacts of global climate change within the polar regions and to understand the implications this has globally. Polar research also allows us to gain fundamental new insights into the nature of life on Earth, and (through polar based astronomy and astrophysics research) to better understand the universe in which we live.  SCAR and IASC often provide direct input to international policy decisions (for instance, regarding fisheries management and biodiversity conservation) through the Antarctic Treaty process and through the Arctic Council, respectively. Thus, U.S. support for these programs can often affect important policy and management decisions.  The PRB's role as U.S. National Committee to SCAR and IASC means that we facilitate the participation and leadership of U.S. scientists in international research and assessment activities, which helps to build good will, establish relationships, and ensure U.S. visibility and leadership in the international scientific community.
