<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Automated Collaboration Assessment Using Behavioral Analytics project will&lt;br/&gt;measure and support collaboration as students engage in STEM learning activities.&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration promotes clarifications of misconceptions and deeper understanding of concepts&lt;br/&gt;in STEM which prepares students for future employment in STEM and beyond. This project&lt;br/&gt;aligns with the goal of the Cyberlearning for Work at the Human-Technology Frontier program to&lt;br/&gt;fund exploratory research that supports learners in working productively in technology-rich&lt;br/&gt;STEM environments. Collaboration is an important learning skill in K-12 STEM education, yet teachers have few&lt;br/&gt;consistent ways to measure and support students’ development in this area. This project will&lt;br/&gt;result in both an improved understanding of productive collaboration and a prototype&lt;br/&gt;instructional tool that can help teachers identify nonverbal behaviors and assess overall&lt;br/&gt;collaboration and engagement quality. Using nonverbal behaviors to assess engagement will&lt;br/&gt;decrease dependence on discourse and content-based dialogue and increase the transferability&lt;br/&gt;of this work into different domains. This project is particularly timely as the ability to collaborate&lt;br/&gt;and engage in group work are growing requirements in professional and learning settings; at the&lt;br/&gt;same time the very act of collaboration is being disrupted by the Coronavirus pandemic and&lt;br/&gt;there is a high likelihood that much of this “new normal” (social distancing; combining in-person&lt;br/&gt;and remote collaboration) will be with us for some time. This project will meet the urgent need&lt;br/&gt;currently felt by educators and educational institutions to support the development of&lt;br/&gt;collaboration skills among students, even as the very act of collaboration is shifting and nontraditional&lt;br/&gt;forms of education are taking hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration between the Center for Education Research and&lt;br/&gt;Innovation (CERI) and Center for Vision Technology (CVT) at SRI International (SRI) and will&lt;br/&gt;capture multiple students’ actions as they work collaboratively face-to-face, both in-person and&lt;br/&gt;through a virtual platform. This project will use a collaboration conceptual&lt;br/&gt;model, multistage predictive and explainable machine learning models, and video analytics to&lt;br/&gt;assess and report on collaborative behaviors and interactions. The behavior analytics system&lt;br/&gt;will use facial expressions, body movements, and meta-information about the collaboration task&lt;br/&gt;to identify interactions that show how students contribute to the collaboration, individually and&lt;br/&gt;collectively. This 2-year project will use reliability and model prediction testing and sequential,&lt;br/&gt;correlation, and thematic analyses of video recordings, surveys, interviews, and student artifacts&lt;br/&gt;to answer the following research questions: Can machine learning models reliably assess&lt;br/&gt;collaboration when compared to human assessments? How do individual behaviors during&lt;br/&gt;collaboration lead and relate to group level interactions and collaboration quality? and Can we&lt;br/&gt;validate and relate the assessed collaboration behaviors to student outcomes as represented by&lt;br/&gt;group-generated artifacts? The intellectual merits include contributions to the advancement of&lt;br/&gt;two fields: (1) machine learning— by developing and exploring new algorithms that generate&lt;br/&gt;explainable collaboration skill assessments and teacher/student dashboards at different grain&lt;br/&gt;sizes of the interactions, and (2) learning sciences—by contributing a collaboration conceptual&lt;br/&gt;model that shows how specific skills, interactions, and behaviors correspond to collaboration&lt;br/&gt;quality at group and individual levels. Broader impacts of this work include increasing the&lt;br/&gt;availability and types of feedback presented to instructors and learners from diverse&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds. This will expand the settings and number of individuals who can be evaluated and&lt;br/&gt;supported on collaboration by making collaborative learning easier to monitor through tools that&lt;br/&gt;can be used by a wide audience of educators and professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  In this project, Automated Collaboration Assessment Using Behavioral Analytics, the Center for Education Research and Innovation (CERI) and Center for Vision Technology (CVT) at SRI International (SRI) developed a collaboration conceptual model that defines collaboration and characterizes and identifies prominent behaviors for in-person and online collaboration. We also developed preliminary machine learning models grounded in our collaboration conceptual models that use group and individual behaviors and participant facial patterns to determine collaboration quality for in-person and online group settings. This project is predicated on collaboration as a growing requirement in current professional and learning settings with few consistent ways to measure and support understanding of collaboration processes; namely, how collaboration progresses over time and what participants do to promote or detract from building new knowledge and quality co-produced artifacts through collaboration. We used reliability testing, model prediction testing, and sequential, correlation, and thematic analyses of video recordings, surveys, interviews, and student artifacts of 50 groups of racially, ethnically, gender, and age diverse people to answer three research questions: 1) Can machine learning models reliably assess collaboration when compared to human assessments?; 2) How do individual behaviors during collaboration lead and relate to group level interactions and collaboration quality?; and 3) Can we validate and relate the collaboration behaviors assessed (using an automated collaboration assessment tool) to student outcomes as represented by group-generated artifacts?     We contribute a collaboration conceptual model (CCM) that characterizes how collaborative behaviors integrate and organize into different qualities of collaboration and a standardized rubric that uses behavioral observations to assess group interactions. The CCM was the underlying driver for the development of machine learning models and subsequent inquiries about how behaviors and interactions contribute to collaboration quality. We contribute machine learning models that provide behavioral insights for collaboration. These insights use the CCM to describe and explain collaboration outcomes based on human behavioral patterns and interactions. Our machine learning work showed that visual cues alone present challenges for assessing collaboration but can provide insights into behaviors that are useful or detrimental to productive collaboration. We achieved 66% F1 score performance when we compared human annotations and machine learning model performance, showing promise for behavior as an indicator for collaboration processes and machine learning as a viable approach for collecting data on collaborative behavior. As we move into online learning spaces, we found that emotion recognition from facial expressions is a more viable approach to infer the overall collaboration state of the group, since the face is the most visible aspect of the individual in an online setting. Our study, using statistical analyses and network analyses, also highlighted the use of gestures to enhance speech at pivotal moments of productive struggle during collaboration that can lead to higher quality artifacts. Additionally, sustaining collaboration was found to be determined by the type of role (e.g., contributor, coordinator) each individual played and how that role changed over the course of the collaboration process. Participants who reported confidence and proficiency in the subject matter were more likely to be active and equal contributors to the collaboration process, leading to more successful collaborations.     Our project produced 14 publications and conference presentations. We also patented our machine learning models. We were advised by a reputable and knowledgeable advisory board who provided formative and summative feedback to our work. We also presented videos in the 2021 (awarded Facilitator's Choice) and 2022 STEM for All Showcases. Future work from this project includes the use of large language models to study collaboration which would reduce the need for human annotators, modify algorithms for assessing collaboration, and assess science understanding using student speech about the content. Future work also would explore approaches for designing collaborative tasks, activities, and learning experiences that engage and immerse students in productive collaborative learning. Finally, we would explore how individual roles relate to collaboration quality in terms of how roles are created and negotiated, how they evolve over time, and how they relate to confidence in collaboration engagement.
