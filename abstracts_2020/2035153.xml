<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This RAPID project will investigate the atmospheric impacts of the large changes in pollutant emissions due to the massive social and economic slowdown of activity related to the Covid-19 pandemic in the U.S.  The research includes the conduct of systematic light aircraft flights to survey urban and industrial emissions sources in the atmospheres of Denver CO and Houston TX to assess the effects of the emissions changes on the production of ozone. Quantifying the impact of such a large emissions change on urban ozone formation rates and yields provides a rigorous and nearly unprecedented check on the models used for U.S. regulatory and research purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will conduct twenty 5-hour research flights surveying concentrations of ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and water vapor (H2O) in the atmosphere over the cities of Houston TX and Denver CO.  The scientists will collaborate with both academic and government modelers to infuse the unique data from this study into a 3-D WRF-Chem research chemical transport model (CTM) to challenge and improve the representation of ozone chemistry, both for this acute situation and under routine emissions scenarios. Historical, highly detailed, research-quality atmospheric data are available for both cities, including data from recent field campaigns in Denver and in Houston. Both cities represent tractable area sources appropriate for study using light aircraft. Houston and the surrounding areas are home to the majority of the U.S. gasoline refining capacity, as well as significant petrochemical industrial capacity. Denver has a substantial number of mobile sources and the region hosts a high level of oil and natural gas activity. This research will provide a benchmark for chemical rates and yields in models. The project takes advantage of this unique opportunity to assess the effects of dramatically changed emissions on ozone production and will gather the data needed to challenge and improve regulatory and research models in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Covid-19 pandemic has had (and continues to have) profound impacts on human society.  Early in the pandemic, a number of policies led to a drastic and temporary reduction in urban activities that emit pollutants and greenhouse gases to the atmosphere &ndash; in particular large reductions in on-road vehicle emissions.  The unprecedented change in emissions provides a potential opportunity to improve our understanding of some pollutants, in particular ozone production in urban environments with very different chemical regimes.  In this project a series of research flights, totaling 100 hours, were conducted in Summer of 2020 over the cities of Denver and Houston, sampling summertime ozone production conditions as each city emerged from lockdown and vehicle traffic increased.  Each of these cities have extensive histories of prior atmospheric chemistry studies, providing a baseline constraint for ozone production to contrast with the perturbed environment with lower emissions of volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides.  Flights were conducted with a Mooney aircraft in a raster pattern of horizontal flight legs within the daytime boundary layer, across and downwind of the urban and industrial centers, capturing fresh emissions and measuring nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, and water vapor.  Distinctive urban plumes and ozone production was observed in all flights.  This dataset is now publicly available as part of the University of Michigan Deep Blue archive, doi: https://doi.org/10.7302/nntt-4825 for any researchers to use to evaluate their modeled production of ozone.  Preliminary comparisons with WRF-Chem simulations exhibit periods of agreement and disagreement, suggesting this dataset can improve ozone production model representations.
