<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Southern Regional Algebra Conference (SRAC) 2020 will be held at Georgia College &amp; State University in Milledgeville, Georgia on March 20-22, 2020. This conferences series, established in 1988, plays an important role for the algebra research community in the Gulf Coast Region, which incorporates many institutions whose student populations are under-represented in the mathematical sciences. This funding will allow graduate students, young mathematicians, faculty from small institutions, undergraduate institutions, and institutions that serve under-represented groups to present their research as well as network with faculty from larger comprehensive research institutions. The resulting increased participation of faculty in the Gulf Coast Region at SRAC 2020 and future SRAC meetings will foster collaboration between primarily undergraduate institutions and larger comprehensive universities. In turn this will help to recruit more students, including members of under-represented groups, to Ph.D. programs in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This yearâ€™s program has three sessions. One of these sessions will specialize in recent developments in commutative algebra. A second session will concern computational methods in algebra and representation theory. The third session will be a contributed session comprising topics in other areas of algebra and their applications. The meeting will have potential significant impact on undergraduate research activities at participating institutions, as well as fostering a network that facilitates colloquia and seminar visits of researchers at partner institutions, serving as a platform for both recruitment and employment of mathematicians in the region. More details may be found at the conference series website: https://www.gcsu.edu/artsandsciences/math/southern-regional-algebra-conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant was obtained to help pay travel expenses for participants at the Southern Regional Algebra Conference in 2020 (SRAC 2020). However, dure to the Covid 19 Pandemic, the conference was postponed to be held virtually in 2021, then on the Georgia College Campus in 2022. This conference hosted  about 40 participants from various states in the United States, delivering nearly 30 presentations. This program was scheduled in 4 different sessions corresponding to different topics in Mathematics. In each session, new research was presented and generated strong discussions potentially leading to new research collaborations. Some presentations had relationships with topics outside mathematics, namely, Data Analysis and Computer Science.  The major goals of this project were to  Expand the Southern Regional Algebra Conference accross (at least) the entire Gulf Coast region. Strengthen collaboration among algebraists in the Gulf Coast region. Increase participation at SRAC meetings from graduate students, early career mathematicians and researchers at undergraduate institutions. Foster retention and inclusiveness of graduate students, early career mathematicians and researchers at undergraduate institutions as part of the research community in algebra. Promote the development of undergraduate research programs within the Gulf Coast Region. Promote visibility of research programs within the Gulf Coast Region at the national and international level.   Because of the support received from this grant, the conference hosted a lot more graduate students, underrepresented and junior professors than in the past years.  They attended very informative presentations on topics in Algebra and many of them gained experience through discussions and presentations of their work. The following are some outcomes of the project:  Participation and involvement from graduate students, early career mathematicians and researchers at undergraduate institutions in the SRAC meetings. Graduate students had the opportunity to discuss with senior professors on Mathematical topics as well as job opportunities in the gulf coast region upon their graduation. The program facilitated collaboration among participants  through organized and informal discussions. The program has now been promoted both nationally and internationally due to participants from several Universities across the United States and abroad.
