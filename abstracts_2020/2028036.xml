<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The forecast and containment of epidemics are central themes in public health and are well-studied in the literature through modeling and simulations.  In the case of COVID-19, the lack of a vaccine, and the limited response to treatment, can lead to possible acute respiratory complications that may nevertheless be non-lethal, provided that patients have access to respiratory support in intensive-care units equipped with ventilation machines. Proactive planning and optimal allocation of resources are key challenges to face in the current emergency.  In this scenario, the project studies the response to the pandemic from a network service point of view. Namely, it aims at determining actionable strategies under which the hospitals' response system can reach an equilibrium state where the spreading of the infection occurs, but the spreading rate does not lead to service overflow. There has been widespread recognition on the need to “flatten the curve,” representative of the infection spreading, and different strategies to achieve this objective have been enforced by governments across the world. The project’s research can be viewed in this context as a principled approach to predict how “the curve” will respond to different strategies, whether it can be kept below the hospitals' saturation threshold for a given amount of time, and what is the societal cost required to achieve this objective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given a service-rate constraint dictated by hospital capacity and dynamic equations describing the spread of the infection, the project aims at deriving a control policy expressed in terms of public-health policies that meets the-service rate constraint of the local health-care system while minimizing their economic impact. Since societal constraints can make such an optimal strategy cost-prohibitive, or infeasible, the project will also study strategies that, given a certain cost budget, lead to the most desirable (time-varying) arrival rate that minimizes the global mortality rate of the population.  While derived solutions are expected to be optimal in the context of the proposed dynamical-system model, results will also be validated using extensive simulations driven by real population data, in order to demonstrate their wider applicability in a practical setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The objective was&nbsp; to design control policies aimed at mitigating the economic impact of COVID-19 under the service rate constraints imposed by a given hospital capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such control strategies must be founded rigorously on models of epidemic spreading that are complex enough to capture the dynamics of real-world disease propagation and yet simple enough to be amenable to mathematical analysis. Therefore, as the first step, we examined the existing epidemic models and selected the <em>age-structured Susceptible-Infected-Recovered</em> (age-structured SIR) model for our subsequent analysis. This model is deterministic (non-random), and it forecasts for every age group of the given population the time-evolution of the fractions of susceptible and infectious individuals over the course of the epidemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the age-structured SIR model is <em>macroscopic</em>&nbsp;(meaning that the equations defining the model only describe epidemic spreading at the level of a large population and disregard disease transmission at the individual level), we found it essential to ascertain its technical soundness. We did this as follows: we first used the basic mathematical principles of epidemic spreading to formulate a stochastic epidemic model that describes individual-to-individual disease transmission. Next, we rigorously proved that, as the size of the population grows, the age-structured SIR dynamics are the <em>mean-field</em>&nbsp;limits of the stochastic processes described by our microscopic epidemic model, i.e., we show that&nbsp;the age-structured SIR dynamics approximate&nbsp; the expected macroscopic behavior of the random epidemic processes described by our stochastic epidemic model arbitrarily well. We thus established a strong theoretical foundation for the age-structured SIR model.<br />To further assess the applicability of our general modelling assumptions to the particular case of COVID-19, we performed an empirical validation of our age-structured model. Specifically, we used system identification to estimate the model parameters from a COVID-19 dataset, and we then generated the trajectories of the age-wise numbers of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals in California for a period of 340 days. Our results (Figures~1-3) show an excellent agrement between the generated trajectories and the observed numbers, thereby lending experimental support to our model.<br /><br />Having validated the model, we used it to develop an algorithm that detects changes in the age-wise contact rates during the course of the pandemic. Our results (obtained using a Japanese dataset) show that this algorithm performs as expected.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, we show that the variations that occurred in the inter-age-group contact rates between March 2020 and March 2021 were consistent with the policy changes announced by the government during the same period.

For the long term, we have shown that, if an epidemic satisfies the broad assumptions of our stochastic model, then its propagation across a social network can be described arbitrarily well by the age-structured SIR model, which is simple enough to be analyzed mathematically.
