<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The College of Wooster is acquiring a liquid chromatograph, quadrupole, time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-Q-TOF-MS) to support Professor Paul Edmiston and colleague, Jennifer Faust. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ions' masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. In the time-of-flight (TOF) method of mass spectrometry, the mass-to-charge ratio of an ion is determined by the way in which ions are accelerated by an electric field of known strength. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to many undergraduate students at this institution and serves as a resource for K-12 hands-on research engagement as well as course-embedded research projects designed to broaden diversity as guided by the STEM Success Initiative at the college. The instrument is also utilized by researchers at nearby institutions such a St Cloud State University, Oberlin College, Kenyon College, Ashland University, and Denison University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The instrument acquisition impacts identification of pharmaceutical transformation products in human-impacted surface waters. The LC-Q-TOF-MS is used for investigations of anthropogenic compounds in Hawaiian estuaries by a researcher from St Cloud State University. In addition, the mass spectrometer provides information for studying the fate and transport of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the environment and exploring multiphase reactions of organic components in rainwater. The mass spectrometer is also used to analyze protein cross-linkers to identify redox partners of protein disulfide isomerases and for studying the factors influencing differential allocation of seminal fluid proteins in the fruit fly, D. melanogaster. Finally, the instrument is utilized to study the metabolic role of arginine kinases in bacteria and the use of unnatural amino acids to generate chromophores for fluorescence imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
