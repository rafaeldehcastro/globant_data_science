<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[COVID-19 data, related to infection rates, at-risk populations, mobility, and commute dynamics are rapidly becoming available from several sources. However, there is a lack of interactive visual decision-making environments integrated with data-driven tools to help public health and community leaders understand how various factors such as physical distancing and other mitigation strategies, impact the spread of disease, help flatten the curve, enabling economic recovery while minimizing public health risk due to reopening. This project will develop visual analytic tools for tracking COVID-19 and propose balanced intervention strategies for effective containment of the outbreak.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed visual analytics system integrates heterogeneous datasets and enables the application of relevant analytical models and data-engineering for decision support in a complex and evolving crisis. The objectives include the development of (1) forecasting models for recovery based on incidence, population vulnerabilities, mobility patterns, and mitigation activities, (2) social-media tools to understand public sentiment and risk perceptions, (3) visual interface for model-refinement &amp; diagnosis through data engineering and visual analytics principles. The decision-making framework will offer new insights, close the gap between data and decisions, and is driven-by inputs from extensive partnerships &amp; collaborations to improve reliability and usability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data-driven tools will help improve decision makersÃ­ understanding of disease dynamics from multiple variables. Epidemiologists could potentially leverage these insights to create higher-fidelity models based on interventional factors and their effect on population behaviors. Local authorities could also utilize the models to make life-saving decisions while minimizing impact to the economy. The project will enable new public and private partnerships including the City of New Orleans, and Industry Advisory Board of NSF Center for Visual and Decision Informatics. The project will benefit graduate and undergraduate students through hands-on research experience with the development of analytical products. The project outcomes will include analytics dashboards, source code, models, and data collected from multiple sources. The dashboards, project descriptions, and a list of data sources along with their metadata will be made publicly available on www.vastream.net for a period of two years. The public facing portion of the portal for COVID-19 component will be moved to Amazon cloud in event of disruptions from outages, for the duration of the project.  A new public repository will be created on GitHub, and the source code and publicly available datasets will be made available on this project repository.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Containing the COVID-19 pandemic while balancing the economy has proven to be quite challenging for the world. This is because there was a lack of tools to help public health and community leaders understand how various factors, such as physical distancing and other mitigation strategies, impact the spread of disease, help flatten the curve, enable economic recovery while minimizing public health risk due to reopening. The overall goal of the project titled "RAPID: Visual Analytics Approach to Real-Time Tracking of COVID-19" was to help community leaders make risk assessments to make decisions about the containment of COVID-19 risks and the phased reopening of the economy. The visual analytics decision-making tools integrated data from multiple sources (on infection rate, at-risk populations, mobility, and community dynamics) to help track and understand various indicators relevant to containing the spread and reopening of the economy.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The project team developed a dynamic risk-based dashboard, the COVID-19 Resilient Economy Support Tool (CREST), in collaboration with the City of New Orleans during the project to help the city officials get visibility into various aspects of the pandemic (http://crest.vastream.net/). The interdisciplinary team of data scientists, epidemiologists, and public health officials worked collaboratively to understand the key gaps in decision making, identified and collected over 19 different data sources, and developed statistical and machine learning-based models and risk maps that integrate these datasets. The models were developed and validated in a continuous development and deployment mode by leveraging the big data infrastructure and visual analytics tools from VAStream, a big data sandbox environment funded by NSF. The risk-based dashboards show the growth trend of COVID-19, changing worker and visitor mobility dynamics, and occupational risk to frontline workers.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The New Orleans city officials used these dashboards to identify the vulnerable areas in the city where more testing and hospital resources are to be deployed. The mobility-based risk maps were used to identify locations where increased enforcement is required. Three peer-reviewed journal articles were published as part of the project. The project team also presented the ongoing work at the NSF Pandemic Research for Preparedness and Resilience (PREPARE) workshop. One Ph.D. student, one master's student, and two undergraduate students participated in the research, and 18 graduate students used datasets generated from this project as part of their Applied Machine Learning class course work. All the data sources and relevant source code were publicly available on GitHub.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The expertise gained in this project enhanced the knowledge for building data analytics solutions in public health, emergency management, and recovery from disasters in an ever-changing scenario. The visual analytics tools developed during this project can be used to combine data from multiple sources, clean, wrangle, extract features, develop models, visualize the data, and test the performance of the models. These models can help better understand the data, reduce the time from data ingestion to analysis, and test the model's validity. The collaboration between UL Lafayette and the City of New Orleans enabled us to understand the factors contributing to COVID-19 and identify vulnerable populations, which helped us design proposals like Vax-Up with the Louisiana Department of Health to identify populations and outreach efforts to improve vaccination in the State of Louisiana. The data collected during the effort and the analysis produced were used to identify populations that are vulnerable to COVID-19 and need additional assistance from students from other universities across the United States, Finland, and Sweden. The data collected and the models built during this project are publicly available for researchers.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/05/2022<br>      Modified by: Raju&nbsp;Gottumukkala</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664980521255_ImpactofIndustry--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664980521255_ImpactofIndustry--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Impact of Industry Sectors due to COVID-19 for the City of New Orleans"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664980521255_ImpactofIndustry--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Impact of Industry Sectors due to COVID-19 for the City of New Orleans"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The projected impact on jobs across various industry sector within the city of New Orleans during COVID-19 related closures</div> <div class="imageCredit">UL Lafayette</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Raju&nbsp;Gottumukkala</div> <div class="imageTitle">Impact of Industry Sectors due to COVID-19 for the City of New Orleans</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664979849469_LocalvsVisitor--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664979849469_LocalvsVisitor--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Local vs visitor transmission risk for various phases of the pandemic"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664979849469_LocalvsVisitor--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Local vs visitor transmission risk for various phases of the pandemic"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Local transmission risk and visitor transmission risk across various phases of the pandemic (from March 2020 to December 2020).</div> <div class="imageCredit">UL Lafayette</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Raju&nbsp;Gottumukkala</div> <div class="imageTitle">Local vs visitor transmission risk for various phases of the pandemic</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664979933929_Contributionofvarious--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664979933929_Contributionofvarious--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Contribution of various non-pharmaceutical factors and mobility to COVID-19 growth patterns"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664979933929_Contributionofvarious--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Contribution of various non-pharmaceutical factors and mobility to COVID-19 growth patterns"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Association of various factors (mobility and non-pharmaceutical interventions) contributing to various growth phases of the pandemic for United States</div> <div class="imageCredit">UL Lafayette</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Raju&nbsp;Gottumukkala</div> <div class="imageTitle">Contribution of various non-pharmaceutical factors and mobility to COVID-19 growth patterns</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664979800771_RiskMapbyOccupation--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664979800771_RiskMapbyOccupation--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Risk Map by Occupation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027688/2027688_10671842_1664979800771_RiskMapbyOccupation--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Risk Map by Occupation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The projected infection risk to various zip codes within the city of New Orleans due to visitor mobility</div> <div class="imageCredit">UL Lafayette</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Raju&nbsp;Gottumukkala</div> <div class="imageTitle">Risk Map by Occupation</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
