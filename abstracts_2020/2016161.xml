<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The 2020 IEEE International Symposium On Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machine (FCCM) will be held in Fayetteville AR from May 03 to May 06, 2020.  FCCM is a forum for presenting and discussing new research related to computing that exploits the unique features and capabilities of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and other reconfigurable hardware, development on architectures, tools, programming models and applications. The conference is organized over multiple technical sessions, workshops, panels and a demo night where companies, research groups and students present the latest development in the field. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Travel grants will make possible the participation of 15 graduate and undergraduate students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds. Besides attending technical sessions and learning about latest developments in the field of FPGA, students will benefit from interaction with leading researchers, companies and institutions in the field. This can lead to Internships and full employment opportunities between students and participating companies. Priority will be given to first time attendees, especially those seeking research topics and in the early stages of developing their research agendas. A portion of the award will be devoted to under-represented groups for which substantial recruitment efforts will be undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
