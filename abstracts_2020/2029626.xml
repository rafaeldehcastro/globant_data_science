<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[There is still much we do not understand about the spread of COVID-19, and how our mitigation strategies are affecting the spread. Demography, population density, business structure, and social culture differ across regions. Correlating these local factors with the number of infections and the availability of hospital resources can provide precious scientific and data-driven guidance to local policy makers. Different from existing, classic epidemic models, in this project we aim to build novel forecasting models based on cutting-edge AI techniques. The goal is to provide timely, localized information needed by administrators for strategic allocation of resources and planning towards reopening business.  One key advantage of our approach is that it is able to combine the data from regions with more COVID-19 cases with the US Census microdata that characterize each local community, hence helping us to make fine-grained predictions of the localized effects of a policy decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing simulation models for COVID-19 cases forecasting either ignore the fine-grained demographical, social and cultural difference at local communities, or often require complicated, manual parameter setting for estimating the effect of interventions. Existing statistical models, on the other hand, require substantial amount of data to be available, hence are not able to obtain sufficiently confident predictions on each local level. We propose a fundamentally different approach that is built on the newest neural network models like Transformers to overcome these weaknesses.  The proposed approach performs domain adaption and few shot learning, so that knowledge learned from other regions can be adapted to local communities even when only a few data points are available. Specifically, our approach will creatively draw information from the US Censusâ€™s American Community Survey data, COVID-19 related data from other regions at home and abroad, as well as other related kinds of epidemics under the clinical guidance of our collaborators from the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Our project has delivered deep time series models and significant clinic results.  We trained a diversified group of students and a specialist who have joined the AI workforce. At the end of 2020, we participated in a large national team working on COVID19 forecasting, including forecasting newly confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths.  Our algorithm, "Inter-Series Attention Model for COVID-19 Forecasting" addressed the following question: Can a direct data-driven approach without modeling the disease spreading dynamics outperform the well referred compartmental models and their variants?  We showed that it is fully possible.  Among 13 out of 18 testing cases, our model outperformed the leading COVID-19 forecasters highlighted by CDC (in late 2020).  Our effort together with other teams? has been included in the summary paper, ?Evaluation of individual and ensemble probabilistic forecasts of COVID-19 mortality in the US,? published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) 2022. We further studied how to provide a risk-stratification methodology for identifying severe COVID cases at the time of admission. We identified certain clinical parameters that can be easily measured in a clinical setting and can be used to identify cases at risk of progressing to severe cases. During the course of developing various new methods, we were able to train two female researchers, Ms. Rachel Redberg, who recently received her Ph.D. degree and Ms. Kanika Mahajan who significantly improved her machine learning skill.  Kanika was funded by UCSB and recently got promoted to Associate Specialist, Step III. We introduced a COVID19 severity forecasting problem as a course project in CS165B, Machine Learning (Spring 2023), which has inspired our undergraduate students to take advanced machine learning courses in the future and pursue graduate study in AI. The source code of multiple time series forecasting methods was released to the public via github and received frequent citations.  A strong collaboration relationship has been built with a local hospital to further investigate how to extend our discovery in other clinical areas.
