<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Innovation has been examined from multiple perspectives nevertheless; the impact of process and product innovation on firm performance is mixed. To better estimate the relationship between R&amp;D investment and firm performance, this project will consider new data that allows for a clear distinction between different forms of R&amp;D investment, product vs. process innovation and firm performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) Business Research and Development Survey (BRDIS) data provide rich data firm level to examine the effect of R&amp;D investment on firm product innovation and process innovation, through the Census Bureau Census Data Center. This exploratory work will begin to examine the data series that begins in 2011. &lt;br/&gt;]]></AbstractNarration>
