<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will create new methods of using optical fibers for examining tissue for early signs of cancer. Although optical detection of early cancer has been shown, there has yet to be a technology that can be readily used by clinicians. This new method will be simpler and less costly to build than previous approaches and thus will provide a societal benefit by enabling greater use of optical methods for detecting early cancer in the clinic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a novel approach for detecting early cancer based on angle resolved light scattering. The unique aspect of this new approach is that rather than measuring scattering at different angles at the tissue surface, instead a single, multimode fiber will be used to collect all of the angular scattering and then computational methods will be used to reconstruct the angular distribution.  The approach will permit simplified measurements and analysis by using knowledgeof the distribution of scattering from cell nuclei, specifically that it forms ringed patterns.  A key proposed advance of this work will be to enable use of the fiber even when it is moved, for example during an endoscopy procedure, by leveraging the simplified measurements and introducing a real time calibration method.  The approach will be demonstrated by measuring enlarged nuclei in cultured cancer cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied how scattered light is transmitted through multimode fiber.  Scattered light can be used in biomedical applications to learn about tissue structure to find signs of disease such as cancer.  In order to use scattered light to examine parts of the body, an endoscope is typically used.  By using multimode fiber, it is possible to create small diameter endoscopes for light scattering.   A unique discovery of this project was that scattered light with azimuthal symmetry can be transmitted through a multimode fiber, even when that fiber is moved.  Many efforts have sought to overcome the limitation of moving the fiber when using multimode fiber for endoscopes.  This finding can have a significant broader impact in that it can help create simple, low-cost instrumentation for biomedical optics measurements.  The approach developed a novel measurement technique for the field of transmission through multimode fibers by implementing spectrally resolved detection.  Usually, light transmitted through a multimode fiber will be corrupted by speckle, an interference effect that causes a grainy appearance.  However, speckle changes slightly with wavelength.  By measuring many different speckle patterns with slightly different wavelengths, the effects of speckle can be eliminated.    This project used spectrally resolved detection to measure light scattered by small objects meant to simulate cell organelles.  Previous work has shown that measuring the size of cell nuclei using light scattering can enable detection of early stage cancer.  In this project in vitro cells were used as a target sample and it was shown that the angular distribution of scattered light could be accurately measured after transmission through a multimode fiber and the analyzed to determine the size of the cell nuclei.    With further development the advance in this project can be translated to clinical use for detecting early stage cancer in organs such as the esophagus, cervix and colon.
