<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award  to Morgan State University supports the 2020 annual conference of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) themed “Achieving the Vision – From First Principles to the Future.” The conference is designed for students (undergraduate and graduate), post-docs, faculty and other researchers. The NSBP annual scientific conferences are part of NSBP’s plan to increase the pool of African American physicists available in the academic pipeline and STEM workforce. The goals of the NSBP Conference are to provide mentorship opportunities, increase participant access to recruiters, offer networking opportunities and inform the broader community in physics and related areas on best practices based on the outcome of evaluation of the workshop. The NSBP Conference directly addresses (1) the NSF’s 10 Big Ideas, including Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, Windows on the Universe, and the objectives of NSF INCLUDES and (2) the recommendation of the American Institute of Physics TEAM-UP report that professional societies work with funding agencies to commit to achieving the goal of doubling the number of bachelor’s degrees in physics and astronomy awarded to African Americans by 2030. The conference will be held online on November 6-8, 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 2020 Conference of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP 2020) was the largest academic meeting of minority physicists in the United States. The goal of the conference was to provide mentorship opportunities, increase participant access to recruiters, offer networking opportunities and inform the broader physics community on effective practices gleaned during and after the meeting. &nbsp;In November 2019, NSBP planned to have their 2020 annual meeting at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in New York. The COVID-19 pandemic forced NSBP to change the format of the 2020 annual meeting to a completely virtual meeting for the first time.&nbsp; Thus, NSBP 2020 conference was 100% online. &nbsp;Participants from all over the world were able to participate in this professional meeting. The closing address was given by The Honorable Sethuraman "Panch" Panchanathan, Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF).</p> <p>With its theme of Achieving the Vision: From First Principles to the Future, NSBP 2020 was held from November 5th - 8th. &nbsp;Supported by the NSF DMR Award - 2042135, the conference was planned and conducted jointly by NSBP and Morgan State University in partnership with BNL and Associated Universities Inc. (AUI). NSBP partnered with Oak Ridge Associated Universities Virtual Events (ORAU-VE) to host a web interface that enables conference participants to engage through computers and mobile devices. The ORAU-VE platform provided a hub as a central point of connecting to the various presentations, activities, sessions, and networking opportunities.</p> <p>NSBP 2020 had over 1000 participants, over 300 of those participants were students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.&nbsp; Session topics included Condensed Matter and Material Physics, Fluids and Plasma Physics, Cosmology, Gravitation, and Relativity, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Photonics and Optics, Earth and Planetary Systems Sciences, Medical Physics, and Chemical and Biological Physics.</p> <p>Even though the NSBP 2020 conference was held virtually, the format still allowed students to have close interactions with professional physicists and gain exposure to high-quality scientific researchers and presentations.&nbsp; Many students stated that they found meaningful connections and real learning opportunities to connect with Black and other physicists who inspire and rejuvenate one's passion for pushing to the next level. While there is a desire and longing for the face-to-face option to meet and foster friendships and natural connections, participants appreciated the opportunity to gather, connect, network, and learn with the ease of virtual attendance.</p> <p>The conference continued research focus groups to better understand the effect of the meeting on improving African Americans persistence in the field and their participation in the physics workforce. Most of the focus group participants, for both students and professionals, expressed a deep desire to meet other Black physicists or physicists of color. The evidence supports one of the main objectives of NSBP 2020, which is to provide meaningful and scientifically-driven opportunities for Black physicists to meet other Black physicists or other physicists of color. NSBP 2020 focus group participants highlighted the importance of NSBP with critical opportunities to network, connect and reconnect, as well as to learn more about what is going on in other research areas and future opportunities. According to focus group participants, this theme, centered around networking, is more than just getting the next position. The participants captured and articulated a deeper meaning where 15 connecting and reconnecting with peers and colleagues seem to establish something more personal and meaningful. Students and professionals shared that NSBP 2020 was engaging and inspirational. The deep sentiments and heart-felt expressions about being Black and continuing on to pursue important work in the field were palpable. Students often made note that spaces such as NSBP 2020 are not common and there is a positive family-like relationship among NSBP members. This observation is likely to be indicative of a significant, positive motivational impact made by the NSBP 2020 Conference.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/28/2022<br>      Modified by: Willie&nbsp;S&nbsp;Rockward</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2042135/2042135_10698027_1648460360272_NSBP2020conferencegraphic(image1of2)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2042135/2042135_10698027_1648460360272_NSBP2020conferencegraphic(image1of2)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NSBP 2020 conference graphic display"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2042135/2042135_10698027_1648460360272_NSBP2020conferencegraphic(image1of2)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NSBP 2020 conference graphic display"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This graphic display captures the theme, dates, and partners of the NSBP 2020 conference.
