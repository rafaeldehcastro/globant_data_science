<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award will support a workshop entitled “Modern methods in microscopy: Elucidating the physical biology of the cell” at the University of Kansas.  This activity will consist of a ten-day hands-on workshop focused on using cutting-edge technology, team building, mentoring by the project team of scientists from underrepresented groups, and follow up support as these scientists from Hispanic-serving Institutions (HIS) scientists prepare NSF proposals.  This workshop will contribute to meeting the national need for a strong, diverse, and inclusive workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop activities will include lectures and hands-on experiences.  Teams consisting of a research faculty director and a scientist from four HSIs will receive training on topics such as calibration and standards, capabilities of bright-field, laser scanning confocal, capFRET, epi-fluorescence microscopy, and imaging ethics.  All members of the workshop and leadership team are from groups underrepresented in STEM.  Participants will learn how to use imaging technologies and resources that greatly advance their research programs that may not be available at their home institutions.  The outcomes of the project will be assessed by the University of Kansas Center for Educational Opportunity Programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal is not to replace existing visual, analytical and learning practices, but to expand and enhance them with through the addition of visual and analytical languages centered in the identities of underrepresented group.  We ain to democratize and diversify microscopist through:  access to imaging tools and visualization technologies, increase trained microscopy practitioners in these advanced technologies and increase their competitiveness through training in team science, build a diverse microscopy community through reinforcing/validating cultural identity and inspires excellence, develop training that is centered in the identities of underrepresented groups for understanding multiscale spatial and temporal dynamics of the cells, identify and train microsopist in spatial language, faciliate participant discover 2D and 3D shape dimensional attributes and change of shape in space and time, learn to explore spatial features and locations (position in space and relationship in space) identify and train microscopist in visual language, and  train participants to communicate their findings.  Training microscopist to communicate their findings does not routinely involve training in visual thinking, visual language, spatial reasoning and spatial language. Visual languages of science are also often centered in the european/western scientific tradition and do not meet students and practitioners from underrepresented groups where they are, in their cultural identities.
