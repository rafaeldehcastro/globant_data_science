<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[In informal science contexts, the word tinkering describes a learning process that combines art, science, and technology through hands-on inquiry. With the growth in popularity of the making and tinkering movements nationwide, these practices are increasingly making their way into early childhood environments where they have great promise to positively impact the early STEM learning experiences of young children. This 2-day conference hosted at the Exploratorium in San Francisco will bring together stakeholders exploring applications of tinkering in informal early childhood environments. The conference will provide opportunities to explore the role, value, and challenges associated with implementing meaningful tinkering interventions in learning environments serving young children. The project seeks to 1) Convene stakeholders from the tinkering and early childhood programs; and 2) further the exploration and evolution of practitioner and researcher knowledge about tinkering in early childhood contexts.  The long-term goal is to support more young children being introduced to STEM learning through tinkering’s adaptable approaches to STEM-learning that align with the developmental needs of this young population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will collaboratively analyze and document the state of the field of STEM-rich tinkering in informal early childhood contexts.  Additionally, the project will deepen relationships across the early childhood tinkering ecosystem.  Additional outcomes include an effort to provide tangible resources to the field highlighting current promising practices and future opportunities for development.  The conference will also provide an understanding of how tinkering interventions may contribute to the development of STEM interest, identity and learning amongst early childhood audiences.  Finally, the conference will bring together research and practitioners to explore how tinkering in early childhood settings can be used effectively to meet the needs of diverse learners including learners from underserved and underrepresented communities.  The project will recruit a total of 75 participants with backgrounds in the field of tinkering and STEM learning, early childhood research, and professional development practices representing a diverse set of institutions and organizations. Research questions for the conference will focus on: 1) What types of supports and professional development do early childhood educators need to facilitate early STEM learning through tinkering? 2) What types of built environment and hands-on materials best support young children's ability to learn STEM content and practices through tinkering? 3) What types of strategies best support caregiver involvement in young children’s learning? 4) What is the role of early childhood tinkering in young children’s STEM learning, interest, and identity development? 5) How can culturally and linguistically sustaining pedagogies be used to ensure equity across a diversity of young learners and their families?  To answer these research questions the project will use qualitative methods before, during and post-conference.  Research methods will include a landscape analysis identifying needs of participants, surveys, observations and informal interviews with participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Tinkering Studio at the Exploratorium, a museum of science, art, and human perception in San Francisco, California, organized Tinkering Together 2022, a conference bringing together stakeholders exploring applications of making and tinkering to support STEAM learning in informal early childhood environments. Tinkering Together broadens participation in informal STEAM learning by furthering exploration of tinkering in the early learning and care community. The Tinkering Studio collaborated with early childhood educators to develop programming with practitioners for practitioners. The outcome was a multimedia online festival that serves as an introduction to tinkering through the perspective of real-world practitioners.  Tinkering Together offers support for educators interested in the initial stages of shifting approaches toward a tinkering approach. These stages include: Awareness/SPARKS  This stage serves to support educators to understand the tinkering approach and how to integrate into their current teaching practice. It is also important that educators become aware of what tinkering looks like in real-life settings, and to visualize the roles of the adult facilitator. Adoption This stage supports educators to test and try the documented tinkering activities, planning cycle, and documentation first-hand. Adaptation In this stage, educators adjust the tinkering activities and facilitation strategies in order to better align to local expectations and educational approach. RECOMMENDATIONS In order for the educator to benefit from the tinkering approach, the Spark, Adopt, Adapt stages complement one another and form the basis for the following recommendations for promising areas for future research and development: 1) Broaden participation in informal science through a variety of tinkering and making-based starting points. The Tinkering Together: EFFECT convening suggests that supporting practitioners to tell stories of STEAM and tinkering practice in their own words as a way of connecting to the diversity, resilience, and inherent strengths of the early childhood field resonate with everyday practitioners. Future areas of development and research could include:  Developing a library of multimedia case studies based on tinkering practices that demonstrate a more detailed explanation of how educators plan, facilitate, and reflect to launch tinkering activities with children. Developing resources to share the ways that tinkering and making support essential learning and developmental milestones, STEAM content and practices, socio-emotional learning, and language development. Developing a research-to-practice collaboration to understand and begin to address "science nervous" early learning educators, caregivers, and community leaders.   2) Develop more making and tinkering-based STEM resources to support early learning practitioners to adopt informal science learning approaches.  Collecting inspiring examples of explorations and activity set-ups that early learning educators can test in their own practice. This will help to get educators started by seeing first-hand the impact of making and tinkering in their own practice.  Producing and testing a set of materials and guides that will support early childhood educators to adopt the approach themselves.  Developing multimedia content that represents a wide range of early learning practitioners and their settings, cultural backgrounds, abilities, and home language. This media library should also connect to informal science learning between the early childhood classroom, home, and other settings in order to support parents to support early care and learning providers to develop science concepts outside of the traditional early learning setting. Developing a research-to-practitioner collaboration to document the ways in which an online community of practice can support the ways of initial adoption for early childhood educators and caregivers.  3) Support the ways in which early learning educators and caregivers have engaged in adapting, making and tinkering explorations within their practice, in order to focus on core values, cultural connections, and specific learning goals.  Deepening the global community of practice in ways that highlight the shifts in making and tinkering experiences, in order to address context-specific goals, develop informal science fluency for adults, and strengthen connection to local cultural practices. Creating an online repository of culturally relevant making and tinkering explorations that have been tested and refined by early learning educators across a variety of settings and experience levels. Engaging in longitudinal research efforts capturing shifts in practice of early learning educators over time (from sparking, to adopting, to adapting) and capture learning and development indicators in young children as they engage in more tinkering and making inspired explorations.
