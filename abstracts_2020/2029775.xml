<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This doctoral dissertation project will investigate how a culturally and ecologically important tree species, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), has physiologically adapted to disturbances such as fire in high-elevation subalpine forests in mountain environments. Wildfire, insect outbreaks and diseases play an important role in creating conditions in which whitebark pine (WBP) forests can persist in high-elevation ecosystems. Subalpine forest tree species have developed different strategies to survive these disturbances including the growth of thick bark to survive fires and resin ducts that expel insects such as mountain pine beetles. This research will evaluate the different strategies used by WBP trees to survive disturbances. The results will provide insights into different growth and defense strategies that may be beneficial to increasing survivorship and promoting WBP establishment and persistence. Better understanding how WBP trees respond to disturbance will provide valuable information for natural resource managers tasked with maintaining WBP stands into the future. Furthermore, this project will support the training of a doctoral student. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire, insect outbreaks and disease play an important role in the long-term establishment and persistence of WBP forests, however, research is lacking to understand the growth mechanisms that WBP trees use to persist under different histories of disturbance. Our research will assess the influence of wildfire and mountain pine beetle activity on WBP physiology by examining growth (ring-widths) and defense characteristics (duct anatomy and resin chemistry) for over 200 trees at three different high-elevation forest sites. This research will provide important information on the characteristics and conditions under which WBP respond to multiple disturbances that are increasing in subalpine forests. This work is important for restoration efforts to sustain ecologically important WBP forests into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Whitebark pine (<em>Pinus albicaulis</em>) is a culturally and ecologically significant high-elevation conifer that has suffered widespread mortality over the past century, due to the cumulative effects of changing climate, disturbance regimes, and the introduction of white pine blister rust, an exotic pathogen which targets five-needle pines. Whitebark pine trees play a crucial role in retaining snowpack at high elevations and regulating water availability in essential watersheds during the spring and summer. Moreover, their seeds are highly nutritious and serve as an important food source for various wildlife, including numerous bird species, small mammals, as well as black bears and grizzly bears. The loss of whitebark pine on a large scale could have negative consequences on northern Rocky Mountain biomes, which led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to classify this species as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act in December 2022. However, little is known about the physiological response of whitebark pine to disturbance (e.g., fire, bark beetles, and pathogens) across a range of diverse environmental gradients. Within conifers, resin-based defenses have long been recognized as a primary defense mechanism against a variety of insects and pathogens. Oleoresin produced by trees contain complex mixtures of terpenoids that have numerous insecticidal and fungicidal properties. Research has also identified links between resin duct characteristics in trees (e.g., resin duct size, duct production, duct area) and increased probability of tree survival during bark beetle outbreaks. Whitebark pine has co-evolved with a suite of biotic and abiotic disturbances and individual trees allocate resources towards both growth and resin-based defenses, making it a good candidate species to evaluate growth and defense relationships. Utilizing a unique tree-ring dataset of whitebark pine collected on the Flathead Indian Reservation in northwestern Montana (Figure 1), we set out to investigate the following research questions: (1) Are there differences in physiology (tree growth and resin duct anatomy) between trees that persisted through recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks and trees that died? (2) Does constitutive resin chemistry differ between whitebark and co-occurring lodgepole pine and are there relationships between tree growth, resin duct anatomy and resin chemistry? (3) Does competition influence constitutive resin chemistry in either whitebark or lodgepole pine? and (4) Is whitebark pine growth and/or resin duct anatomy constrained by warmer and/or regionally drier conditions? We found that whitebark pine trees that have persisted through recent stand-level disturbance produced fewer but larger resin duct structures with greater duct area compared to trees that died (Figures 2, 3). We also detected important differences in the chemical composition of resin between whitebark and lodgepole pine that generally support field observations, whereby under endemic scenarios mountain pine beetle preferentially select lodgepole pine, while under outbreak scenarios, beetles successfully colonize whitebark pine trees (Figure 4). We found complex relationships between tree growth, resin duct anatomy and constitutive resin chemistry that present beetles with many permutations of resin-based defenses, while competition, particularly with Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) can further influence constitutive resin chemistry (Table 1). Lastly, we found that high-elevation whitebark pine trees growing in an energy-limited system experienced increased growth and defense under warmer and regionally drier conditions, with climate variables explaining a substantive proportion of variation (~20&ndash;31%) in tree diameter growth and resin duct anatomy (Figure 6). Our results suggest that whitebark pine growth and defense was historically limited by short growing seasons in high-elevation environments; however, this relationship may change in the future with prolonged warming conditions. Ultimately, whitebark pine at our study sites exhibit differing strategies in the allocation of resources toward growth and defense. Our results support the idea that maintaining genetic variability promotes diverse response strategies to a complex array of biophysical stressors that might leave a species vulnerable to extinction across its range.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/19/2023<br>      Modified by: Nickolas&nbsp;E&nbsp;Kichas</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2029775/2029775_10690442_1684541127284_Image01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2029775/2029775_10690442_1684541127284_Image01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2029775/2029775_10690442_1684541127284_Image01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Flathead Indian Reservation in northwestern Montana with the two sites (A) and a detailed map of the Boulder (BLD) study site (B) and Three Lakes (3LK) study site (C).
