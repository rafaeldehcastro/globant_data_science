<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation-Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to promote industrialization and commercialization of innovative electrified or electrochemically reactive membrane filtration systems for water treatment and pollutant degradation. Decentralized or point-of-use water and wastewater treatment facilities (e.g., landfill leachate, surface and groundwater remediation, and hospital discharge) could benefit from this membrane process to eradicate potentially hazardous water pollutants, improve downstream treatability or degradation efficiency, and lower environmental and health risks from the exposure or discharge of water pollutants such as industrial solvents or additives. The research outcome will provide information for the rational design of electrochemical membrane systems that exhibit new features of both pollutant degradation and fouling mitigation. The project may pave the way toward a new generation of reactive membrane filtration development. Moreover, valuable research experiences and commercialization training will be offered to postdoctoral fellows and students to become technology innovators and business leaders in membrane technologies. Under-represented and minority students will be recruited through the Garden State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (GS-LSAMP) program as well as student organizations or chapters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will provide a new fundamental insight into electrochemical degradation for emerging water micropollutants on membrane filtration platforms in an effort to transform traditionally passive filtration processes to chemically reactive systems. The project will explore novel electrical polarizations to induce pulsed surface electrochemical reactions to improve reaction efficiencies and longevity of the electrode membranes.  The project will explore membrane synthesis, characterization, and filtration experiments to promote the fundamental science and engineering principles of electrochemical membranes. The specific goals are to (1) devise novel electrochemical applications of porous electrode membranes to empower pollutant rejection, degradation and fouling mitigation; (2) delineate the chemical stability and longevity changes of the electrode membrane under various electrochemical reactions; (3) demonstrate potential new membrane fouling mechanisms (e.g., dielectrophoresis); and (4) understand new degradation pathways of highly refractory micropollutants such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Electrochemical or electrified membrane technology has been considered as one of the most promising methods for water decontamination owing to its advantages of high separation selectivity, reduced use of potentially hazardous chemicals, easy scale up and continuous operation. The coupling process of membrane technology and electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) is particularly powerful for the destruction of recalcitrant and complex water pollutants. This project developed and investigated electrochemically reactive membranes as porous flow-through electrodes to enhance pollutant removal (filtration and degradation). To date, most studies on ERMs remain at the laboratory scale under well-controlled conditions, while neglecting to explore their effectiveness in real aqueous environments. Furthermore, the implementation of contaminant removal and fouling control in scalable and modular ERMs is challenging, as these processes are heavily influenced by water matrix, module geometry, and filtration hydraulic environments. Therefore, practical applications of ERM require considerable improvement in contaminant removal efficiency and selectivity, material stability, and process sustainability as well as optimization of module design. Given the gap between experimental studies and practical applications, evaluating ERMs, from membrane materials synthesis and working principles to process-limiting factors and energy consumption, is essential for guiding the development of EMs for environmental applications. This NSF PFI project<em> </em>mainly investigated some novel electrode materials for ERMs, membrane aging, membrane fouling, membrane performance with respect to permeability and model pollutant removal (e.g., PFAS), process sustainability (byproducts formation). This project involved (1) synthesis and characterization of electrochemical reactivity of the ERMs membranes made with muti-wall carbon nanotubes, g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, MXene and Cu<sub>2</sub>O of different morphologies such as nanosheet, nanotube, nanospheres. (2) assessing membrane aging and byproducts (Cl and Br based byproducts) formation during electro-filtration. (3) access degradation efficiency toward model refractory micropollutants (PFOA and PFBA).<strong> </strong>(4)<strong> </strong>explore the advantages of AC drive ERMs on membrane fouling control and energy consumption.</p> <p>The major outcomes of this project are multifaceted and composed of journal publications, professional conference presentations, student research training, proposal writing training, development of new research methods and teaching materials. First, the project results in four journal publications with two under review or preparation. For example, we published electrochemical aging and halogen oxides formation on conductive membranes using physicochemical and electrochemical methods to probing the membrane resistance, membrane active sites changing after long-term operation. Moreover, two perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFOA and PFBA) oxidation, adsorption compatibility with novel MXene electrochemical membrane were discovered using electrochemical methods and computational methods. Over the two-year project, six oral and eight poster presentations were delivered at ACS Annual Conference, NAMS and AWWA NJ Meeting. Two PhD students at NJIT have been supported to complete most of the research tasks. Moreover, two master and two undergraduate students and two high school students were involved via various educational programs at NJIT such as Undergraduate Research Innovation (URI), The Garden State LSAMP (Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation) and Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP). One PhD student interacted with industrial partners through the NSF INTERN program that facilitated the instrument training in AFM-SECM, which was successfully established at NJIT and utilized for this project. This characterization technique adds unique strength to the NJIT's research infrastructure and regional nanotechnology development. The other PhD student has been supported to conduct the proposed research and receive industrial internships through various commercialization research activities. During the internship, the student established new networks of professional contacts, mentors, and references via a number of synergistic activities including the north-eastern regional I-Corp training and industries of ion exchange and RO membrane companies, which clearly augmented their preparation toward a successful technology innovator and entrepreneurial leader. The research activities also promoted the development of novel teaching modules that enhanced both undergraduate and graduate curricula or research training opportunities. For example, the URI students and other high school student interns were provided opportunities to learn the use of cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS), kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and AFM-SECM with the direct training from the supported Ph.D. students. The students also had the opportunity to acquire the computational chemistry skills using DFT&rsquo;s Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package and COMSOL Multiphysics and evaluated and simulated organic pollution adsorption, electron transfer on different electrode materials under different operation condition for exploring novel materials, reactor design, operation parameters. With the acquired new skills and scientific research training, two PhD students also independently worked grant proposals and achieved two student research grants ($5000 per project) from New Jersey Water Resources Research Institute (NJWRRI) that supported their study on novel electrochemical nanomaterials for water remediation. Finally, in addition to the above research experiences and training, we are also exploring the application of ERMs on valuable resource recovery such as nitrate from wastewaters. &nbsp;These research outcomes further improve the promising applications for ERMs and will support the design of electrode material, electrofiltration modules, and operating mode.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/06/2023<br>      Modified by: Wen&nbsp;Zhang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016472/2016472_10705506_1696602153763_Fig.1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016472/2016472_10705506_1696602153763_Fig.1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="TOC art for our paper"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2016472/2016472_10705506_1696602153763_Fig.1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="TOC art for our paper"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">3.Ma, Qingquan, Jianan Gao, Courtney Potts, Xiao Tong, Yi Tao, and Wen Zhang.
