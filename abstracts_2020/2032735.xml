<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has created disaster conditions for healthcare in the US, and has intensified the need for adaptive practices in healthcare work. The pandemic has brought high patient loads, rapidly-changing expertise, and shortages of personal protective equipment to hospitals, and consequently it poses significant adaptive challenges for healthcare workers. This problem is especially acute in intensive care units (ICUs), where the healthcare workforce must alter how they interact with their peers and with patients' families while working in close proximity to a contagious agent. Such changes are broadly understood as "resilience." However, the specific conditions of adversity and the creative responses healthcare workers may employ to adapt to them remain underexplored. Understanding how these workers adapt, and how these adaptations might promote resilience against adversity is critical to preventing the transmission of COVID-19. A social scientific study of an ICU's pathways to resilience can help researchers and policymakers understand what might promote resilience, which is important for addressing the current conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, and for preparing for future possible challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in an intensive care unit in a hospital in North Carolina, where the COVID-19 pandemic is now beginning its localized peak. This is a key setting for research, because unlike larger cities but similar to many smaller cities and rural areas, the severity of cases in this study setting is predicted to maximize during the course of the research activities. This will offer the researchers the opportunity to gather detailed data about the dynamics of adaptive processes. The research will focus on different groups of workers in the ICU, and will examine possibly unique aspects to changing healthcare worker resilience practices, and how these social practices might be affecting how people relate to the transmission and spread of the virus. The study methods will include: (1) Semi-structured interviews conducted with ICU staff that address perspectives on the pandemic, to understand how workers  perceive  effects  of  the  pandemic  on  their  daily  work  activities  and  on  their  relationships  with  patients  and families; (2) Open-ended interviews with a purposive sample of key decision-makers in the hospital, to understand how and to what extent care worker perspectives factor into guidelines and protocols; (3) Participant observation in the ICU to describe and understand practices of care work; and (4) Discourse analysis of best-practice materials circulated to staff in the hospital and in the ICU to track how changes in the pandemic register with official protocols and media sources. The multidisciplinary research time of an anthropologist and intensive care physicians offers a uniquely diverse approach to document this under-examined phenomenon of resilience among ICU workers, and to detail the social and workforce aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative ethnographic project examined how healthcare workers craft adaptive responses to the material and social of challenges of COVID-19. The project's major activities included data collection between July 2020 and December 2021 in an academic, quaternary referral hospital in the Southeastern US. The study was approved by the University’s Institutional Review Board and was conducted as a collaboration between COVID-19 pulmonary and critical-care physicians and a medical anthropologist with experience in intensive care settings. We purposively sampled 57 individuals to participate in our study. Participants were recruited via emails sent out by their designated leadership inviting participation. Staff members were asked to contact the authors if they were interested in participating.              Our fieldwork utilized two complementary ethnographic approaches: semi-structured interviews and participant observation. After obtaining informed consent, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n=69) with healthcare workers, averaging 60 minutes.               We analyzed data using thematic analysis. Interview questions and coding of the interviews were conducted by using a pre-specified interview guide and coding tree, but modifications were made by the investigators based on ongoing study findings. Weekly meetings with a coding team entailed writing coding memos written for each interview, discussing those memos, and establishing coding concurrence. This enabled a broader and consistent perspective on the more granular coding of vignettes, quotes, and key terms. The meetings also enabled the researchers to draw connections between interviews, to identify strengths and weaknesses in sample representation, and to adjust accordingly.   We conducted participant observation focused on interactions between workers, evolving technologies, patients, and families by the co-PIs already working in the ICU. This was important for the insights gleaned about labor practices interwoven with spatiality and community. It showed how people grappled with the constantly changing conditions and how use of space and interactions with other workers changed over time, often in unexpected and novel ways. We also collected signs, circulars, and key messages from within the hospital to consider them using critical discourse analysis. In addition, we tracked key themes emerging from the project in national news media.     Our major results suggest closer attention is required to the following themes:  1. Rationing  Embodied labor constitutes sites and practices of shortage or rationing along three domains: equipment and technology, labor, and emotions and energy. The resulting workers’ practices of adaptation and resilience point to a potentially more robust global health labor politics based on seeing rationing as work.  2. Distress  Distress experienced during COVID-19 is markedly different in its chronicity, intensity, and collectivity then what is usually captured as individualized moral distress. Healthcare systems were not designed or equipped to respond to the constant and pervasive distress created by COVID-19. Many providers continued to work despite dramatic transformations in work demands. Others shifted roles in the healthcare field or left the system entirely. Beyond situational instances of individual moral dilemmas, patterns of healthcare work itself are operating as core site of distress. A pandemic that has systematically strained the healthcare system thus is re-scripting the ways that healthcare labor gains its bioethical values. Indeed, some of the actual practices of COVID care may be ironically engendering forms of distress, rather than ameliorating them.  3. Labor  The pervasiveness of strain to healthcare work experienced during the pandemic will require that the healthcare field, and the organizations, institutions, and leaders that comprise it, examine distress structurally and relationally to rethink how care labor is valued and remunerated. A high-level understanding of these factors, which include but extend beyond financial incentives, is imperative. Deeper attention to this awareness is especially necessary amidst calls for policymakers to articulate what the "next normal" of COVID-19 might look like. Will such work be an integral component of the next normal of healthcare? If it is normalized, what can be reasonably expected of healthcare workers? What kinds of institutional and social contracts are possible when they no longer view their jobs in the same ways? Our results suggst that the complex and varied answers to these questions must come from workers themselves.     Our key outcomes include publications in peer-reviewed journals; several conference presentations; training a team of undergraduate research assistants; establishing a collaboration between anthropology and clinical care; and sharing research results with the study project's community of concern.
