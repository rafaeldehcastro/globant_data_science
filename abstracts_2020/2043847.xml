<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[More than 45,000 community water systems in the US are small, each providing water to up to 10,000 people. These systems, which provide a vital supply of potable water to mostly rural communities, are faced with many challenges which are made harder by natural disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19. To better protect these water systems, including during emergency scenarios, this project will develop and test tools to check the status as of these water systems remotely as well and to support the operators who run the systems. This planning project is a collaboration between academic and local government partners to develop and pilot these remote sanitary inspection tools and water quality monitoring systems while at the same time increasing access to skilled personnel in small community water systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to support inspection and monitoring of small water systems and to ensure continuity of operators during and after disasters. The specific aims of the planning period are to: 1) Investigate and pilot tools for conducting remote sanitary inspection and remote monitoring of water sources and treatment infrastructure to improve delivery of safe water in small water systems through disasters and recovery; and 2) Explore a model of enhancing human resource capacity during emergencies in the form of shared operator programs. Partners include the University of Massachusetts Amherst, two regional planning organizations in western Massachusetts (the Franklin Regional Council of Governments and the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission), and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. Specifically, this project will develop and pilot a mobile system which simplifies and streamlines sanitary surveys and inspections for source waters and treatment facilities; evaluate novel water quality monitoring devices for application in small water systems; and develop a model for a shared-operator program for the towns located in three counties. The research questions will address gaps in knowledge in how to support the continuity of small community water supply operations through disasters and were developed from needs identified by civic partners. The proposed project would directly address challenges small communities face due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and help with preparedness for future disasters, including future pandemics and extreme weather events. This project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program, Track B—Resilience to Natural Disasters—and is a collaboration between NSF and the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The vast majority of the more than 50,000 community water systems (CWS) in the US are small water systems, serving fewer than 10,000 people. These small and often rural water systems are resource-constrained and have numerous challenges in regularly delivering water that is safe, reliable, and affordable. These small water systems? limited finances and low capacity further affect their ability to respond to stressors, such as unexpected failures within the system from aging infrastructure or acute emergencies sparked by a natural disaster. For water systems to be resilient, they must have the capacity to respond to and recover from stresses and to assess, manage, and mitigate risks to water supply and quality. This project facilitated a collaboration between academics and local government partners to investigate and develop systems that improved the ability of small community water systems to manage risks to water quality during and after disasters and emergencies. The project partners included the University of Massachusetts, regional planning organizations in Massachusetts (the Franklin Regional Council of Governments and the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission, which serve 69 rural communities), and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. <br /><br />During this project, all partners worked together to build relationships and investigate and plan several initiatives to support the resilience of small community water systems. This included regular meetings between all partners to discuss identified community needs and barriers to water system resilience, engagement with local and state agencies to identify and map available resources, interviews with water system stakeholders, and the piloting of lab-scale tests of a novel sensor for monitoring water system operation. The findings offer insight into what research directions would help support small water systems. The outcomes highlighted the following: 1) Many communities and water systems do not take advantage of existing state and local programs due to lack of awareness, transaction costs, a penchant for independence, and trepidation on the part of small systems to engage with programs they were concerned might have regulatory implications; 2) Small community water systems that have developed formal or informal relationships with neighboring communities have found those networks to be immensely useful during emergencies; 3) Many small water systems that lack a full-time operator do not engage with neighboring communities to seek out opportunities for mutual gains and, while shared water operators (i.e., operates who work concurrently for multiple systems) may provide capacity while easing the burden on a small systems? finances, there may be limits to the contributions of one shared person during more emergencies that affect multiple systems; 4) State agencies have recently started to conduct sanitary surveys remotely; however, they are currently not applicable to the systems most in need of assistance, who require the support and inspection of in-person visits; 5) Many small water systems in our study area have basic online monitoring of water quality and water system operation, which they find to be useful, and would like to increase this capacity; however, barriers include cost and maintenance.<br /><br />These results suggest a need for activities that support network building between water systems and communities and increase adoption and use of existing programs and methods of preparing for emergencies.
