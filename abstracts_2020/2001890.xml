<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project lies at the intersection of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and number theory. It involves applying homotopy theory (a branch of algebraic topology) to study arithmetic and geometry,  using coarse aspects or invariants of spaces to study arithmetic phenomena.  A generalization of the number of d-dimensional holes in a space is used to control the solutions to certain polynomial equations. When d is equal to one, this has applications to a program of Grothendieck to control solutions using the loops on a space.  Maps between certain spaces induce maps between the d-dimensional holes giving rise to a notion of degree. A generalization of degree due to F. Morel is used to study arithmetic properties of singularities. This project furthermore includes the design and implementation of a series of four week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During each of four summers, approximately eight high school students will work on an important mathematical problem which has an elegant or useful known solution, learning the background material as necessary, and then creating learning materials for other students of the same age group. The students will be accompanied by a teacher from their high schools. In addition to the work on the specific mathematical problem, career options in mathematics will be presented and support and mentorship will be provided for students interested in pursuing mathematical careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain arithmetic and geometric phenomena which appear delicate are invariant under appropriate notions of homotopy. Such phenomena motivate the use of homotopy theory to study arithmetic or geometry. The sub-projects contained in this project share the perspective wherein problems in arithmetic or geometry are approached by using Morel-Veoveodky's A1-homotopy theory and applying realization functors. Sub-project 1 studies an enrichment of the Section Conjecture and an approach to proving it. Running the same methods backwards produces results on the differential graded algebra of the absolute Galois group. Sub-project 2 applies an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence in Ã©tale homotopy to compute (co)homology of branched covers. This has applications to the study of the non-abelian Galois representation given by the fundamental group of the projective line with three points removed, and has applications to sub-project 1. The first step of sub-project 3 is to prove a joint conjecture with Jesse Kass that the quadratic form appearing in the Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili Signature Formula can be interpreted as a local degree in A1-homotopy, where the natural notion of degree is a quadratic form. We then enrich the Milnor number and use this enrichment to study arithmetic properties of singularities.]]></AbstractNarration>
