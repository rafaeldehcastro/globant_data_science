<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project supports a March 2020 conference, Women of Color in STEM Entrepreneurship Conference.  The conference focuses on both underrepresented adults and girls of color from Hawaii, Alaska, Saipan and Guam. Arizona State will participate in a 5-day, residential camp at Kohala Institute. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contribution to the field will include: capturing the views of women and girls of color regarding the design of inclusive culturally responsive practices in computing, and enabling inter-generational perspectives to inform theory and practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Going forward, convening a conference addressing these issues that includes professional women in STEM and pre-professional youth would realize the vision of the originally proposed model, and would be a satisfying check on our progress toward the 10-year plan that includes early exposure to computing opportunities, relevant curriculum, and access to appropriate role models and mentors, including industry experts, computer science practitioners, and academic leaders who can immerse them in real tech world experiences, while utilizing strategies listed above.   Building this system and reinforcing this network promises to provide the sustained support throughout the STEM education and career pipeline for underrepresented women and non-binary people.  This in turn holds great promise for broader participation in STEM professions, ultimately invigorating and offering long term diversity and stability to this sector of our economy.
