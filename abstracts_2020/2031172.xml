<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are increasingly central to the research landscape. In light of emerging open science guidance such as by funding agencies, PIDs for institution affiliations is a relatively new development, following PIDs for research outputs (DOIs) and for researchers (ORCID).  Further research and analysis is needed to better understand and explain where open affiliation identifiers should be adopted, how they can connect to other PIDs for research products, and how these linkages can be leveraged to both achieve and enable open research practices across disciplines.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;California Digital Library (CDL) will work with partners in the Research Organization Registry (ROR) project to drive wide adoption of open affiliation identifiers in research infrastructure. CDL will research the current status of affiliation identifiers in existing infrastructure, explore the measurable benefits of adoption of these identifiers with a specific focus on how they enable open science, and develop tools and guidance to support adoption by specific stakeholder groups. This project will result in new tools and guidance for how open affiliation identifiers should be implemented and used to contribute to a more connected set of research products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The project aimed to explore the benefits of open affiliation identifiers, specifically focusing on ROR adoption within existing research infrastructure. It involved analyzing the current state of affiliation identifiers, understanding the advantages of open identifiers for affiliations, assessing their long-term effects on research discovery, usability, and impact, and creating tools and guidance for different stakeholders.  Key Outcomes  The project yielded the following key outcomes:    Data on Affiliation Identifier Usage: Data collection mechanisms were implemented to track ROR ID presence in Crossref and DataCite, which collectively store metadata for numerous scholarly outputs globally. While ROR IDs were associated with only a small fraction of scholarly outputs, their usage has been steadily increasing due to growing interest in persistent identifiers.    ROR API Usage: The usage of the ROR API has been consistently rising, with approximately 25 million monthly requests at the time of this project. Historical data shows a doubling trend every year.    Data Accessibility: The collected data is publicly available on the ROR website and has been shared in community meetings and conferences.    Insights on Benefits and Barriers  Extensive consultations with stakeholders provided insights into the benefits and barriers to adopting open affiliation identifiers like ROR. These insights helped in understanding how stakeholders benefit from ROR and what challenges they face during adoption.  Guidance and Documentation  Based on stakeholder feedback, the project developed guidance, documentation, and case studies to promote ROR adoption:  A documentation platform was established to provide information on ROR usage. A discussion forum was created to facilitate user interaction and knowledge sharing. Tutorials were developed to assist users in working with the ROR API. Case studies featured adopters' experiences and demonstrated how ROR benefited their work.   Key Findings  The project's key findings include:    Usefulness of Open Affiliation Identifiers: Open affiliation identifiers, like ROR, are essential for various use cases related to linking and tracking research outputs. They are integrated into systems for identifying researcher affiliations, streamlining publishing workflows, and tracking research outputs by institutions and funding organizations.    Barriers to Adoption: Several challenges hinder the implementation of open affiliation identifiers:     Existing integration of other identifiers in research systems. Uncertainty about the value of adopting open identifiers. Lack of in-house expertise for implementation. Time and resource constraints.   Addressing Barriers to Adoption  To overcome these challenges and promote the widespread use of open affiliation identifiers, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. Future efforts should involve collaboration with multiple stakeholders at different stages of research workflows.  Broader Impacts  The project aligns with the August 2022 OSTP memo emphasizing the importance of persistent identifiers for enabling the discoverability of research outputs. It has highlighted key use cases for affiliation identifiers in various research contexts and identified ongoing challenges that need to be addressed for these identifiers to reach their full potential.
