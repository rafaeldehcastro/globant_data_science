<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution's faculty and administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and expanding STEM instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keweenaw Bay Ojibway College (KOBCC) serves the L'Anse Indian Reservation in Michigan. The project leaders will conduct a cohesive set of activities that will inform the design of a lower division STEM instructional program, grounded in Anishinaabe culture and a renovated instructional space. The project will entail the key activities of: design the STEM curricula; infuse culture into instruction and identify needed IT resources; specify the physical renovations necessary to craft required instructional space; and consult with peers at similarly situated TCUs. At the end of the planning period, KBOCC should have a concrete plan upon which to develop a STEM instructional capacity-building proposal to implement a model associate degree STEM curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
