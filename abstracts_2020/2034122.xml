<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Nanoparticles come in a variety of sizes, shapes, chemistries, and functionalities, including folded proteins, viruses, and quantum dots. This project will research the motion of individual nanoparticles in complex environments.  Most previous studies of nanoparticle motion have been limited to studies of ensembles of particles or particles in homogeneous environments, and these studies provide a valuable foundation upon which to build. Recent advances in imaging methods and data processing methods enable the study of nanoparticles in heterogeneous environments one particle at a time. A new imaging method provides improved spatial and temporal resolution that detects biomolecules at interface, and the investigators will apply this advanced imaging method to the study of nanoparticle motion at interfaces, particularly interfaces with various functionalities. These studies and fundamental understanding will inform advanced strategies for separating natural or synthetic nanoparticles based on size, shape, or charge. The investigators will mentor undergraduate researchers, engage with public outreach events across Philadelphia, and partner with a program to bring the science laboratory to underserved high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles come in a variety of sizes, shapes, chemistries, and functionalities, ranging from folded proteins, viruses, and quantum dots. Because nanoparticles at interfaces underpin a broad and expanding range of applications including nanoscale filtering and detection, this project will research the motion of individual nanoparticles in complex local environments.  Most previous studies of nanoparticle motion have been limited to studies of ensembles of particles or particles in homogeneous environments, and these studies provide a valuable foundation upon which to build. Recent advances in imaging methods and data processing methods enable the study of nanoparticles in heterogeneous environments one particle at a time. Interferometric scattering microscopy provides exceptional spatial and temporal resolution and was originally developed to image biomolecules at interfaces. This project will use this advanced method to study nanoparticle motion at interfaces, particularly interfaces with various functionalities, and under applied electric fields. These studies and fundamental understanding will inform advanced strategies for separating natural or synthetic nanoparticles based on size, shape, or charge by designing interfaces that selectively trap nanoparticles. This new understanding will also provide  strategies for producing higher quality nanoparticle products with more uniform characteristics. Differentiating mechanisms of nanoparticle dynamics can also lead to advanced sensing applications. PIs Winey and Composto will mentor undergraduate researchers, engage with public outreach events across Philadelphia, and partner with a program to bring the science laboratory to underserved high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
