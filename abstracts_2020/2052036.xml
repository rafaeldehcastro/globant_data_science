<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will lead to a deeper understanding of the statistics of fundamental behaviors of numbers, including how numbers factor and how many solutions there are to given equations. The approach is to use random models to study these seemingly deterministic questions. This research will investigate how mysterious microlevel numerical structures aggregate into universal macrolevel patterns. A fundamental example of this micro-to-macro phenomenon is seen in the ubiquity of the bell curve, which describes many distributions seen in nature, even when they come from different sources. The project will help uncover the analog of the bell curve for fundamental behaviors of numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the distribution of class groups of number fields and function fields will be studied using tools from probability, random groups, arithmetic geometry, algebraic geometry, topology, and number theory.  The project will develop models of random groups that are good approximations for class groups and their non-abelian analogs, and determine the basic probabilistic structure of these models.  Tools from algebraic geometry and topology will be used to prove that distributions of class groups of function fields have behavior that agrees with what is predicted by the models.  This will exhibit new structure in the class groups of number fields and their non-abelian analogs.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed a wide range of tools to address questions in arithmetic statistics.  This is a field whose goal is to understand the distribution of algebraic and arithmetic structures.  For example, a major question is to understand the range of different kind of number systems and how they behave.  We proved major new results bounding the complexity of factorization in different number systems.  Also, many new results were proven that forge new connections between number theory, the study of numbers and primes, and topology and geometry, the study of spaces and shapes.We also proved new results in the probability theory of random matrices.   As part of the project, we proved new results on the probability theory of random groups.These results have been applied in a number of ways.  They led to the discovery of new possibilities for three dimensional spaces that have certain properties regarding how loops in those spaces can behave.  They have lead to the discovery that certain distributions of groups, higher order algebraic structures, have the same mathematical universality as the bell curve or normal distribution.  They have led to the discovery that long believed principles for the distribution of class groups, which control factorization in number systems, are incorrect, and helped us to see how to make conjectural corrections.     In addition, many students were mentored as part of this project, and had opportunities to be involved in mathematical research.  They learned problem solving skills, mathematical communication skills, and increased their technical proficiency.  They also contributed to the mathematical discoveries in this project.
