<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award provides support for students and post-doctoral associates to attend the 6th Midwest Single Molecule Workshop being held in Omaha, Nebraska, August of 2020. Single molecule biophysics techniques make it possible to observe the transient interactions, multiple structural states, and dynamics of biological molecules and their assemblies.  The applications of single-molecule techniques are rapidly expanding, and a constant exchange of ideas is essential to ensure further developments. Topics to be covered at the workshop include direct visualization of molecular dynamics with high-speed atomic force spectroscopy, single molecule fluorescence, single molecule detection, and optical and magnetic tweezers. The two-day meeting will include invited lectures, poster presentations, short talks, and a keynote address â€“ all organized into thematic sections focused on a specific single-molecule methodology. The meeting will provide an essential professional development opportunity for young scientists and expose undergraduate students to timely research topics. Abstracts of the subjects covered will be compiled for a conference booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
