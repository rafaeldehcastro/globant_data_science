<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Bayesian networks are a computational model that is very efficient for computing in the presence of uncertainty. It excels in such tasks as predicting stock market behavior, disease progression, etc. It is ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood of different known causes to have been the contributing factor. For example, given the symptoms of a patient, it can compute the probabilities of various diseases that could be causing the symptoms. Unfortunately, implementing Bayesian networks usually requires complex hardware that is expensive, prone to failure, dissipates too much energy and consumes too much area on a computer chip. The goal of this research is to overcome these disadvantages by replacing traditional electronic hardware with magnetic devices that interact with each other in a special way to elicit Bayesian inference. This can reduce the hardware complexity and all associated costs dramatically, making Bayesian networks compact and efficient. This research will establish the viability of this approach through extensive simulations. Graduate students will be trained in this field to produce a pool of skilled scientists and engineers with cutting-edge knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian networks for computing in the presence of uncertainty leverage Bayesian inference engines implemented with complex hardware that often involves microcontrollers, shift registers, analog-to-digital converters, logic gates, etc. that dissipate exorbitant amounts of energy and have enormous footprints on a chip. It ha recently been shown by the project team that magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) that interact with each other by means of dipole coupling can implement Bayesian networks with vastly reduced energy cost and much smaller footprints.  Two dipole coupled MTJs A and B can realize an extremely efficient 2-node Bayesian network, where the probabilities of high and low resistance states of MTJ A are set by current or voltage, while the (random) resistance state of MTJ B is determined by varying degrees of dipole coupling between the two MTJs. The degree of dipole coupling is tuned with local strain applied to the soft layer of MTJ B using electrical excitation. This allows one to generate any desired anti-correlation or correlation between the resistance states of the two MTJs that can be varied between 0% and 100% using electrical excitation. In turn, this allows the generation of programmable conditional probabilities that can be exploited for Bayesian networks. This research will build a simulation base for this approach, test the viability of MTJ-based inference engines under different scenarios and design optimal sub-systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Bayesian belief networks are very different from conventional digital computers and are ideal for computing in the presence of uncertainties (e.g. disease progression, stock market behavior, etc.). Its primary use is in diagnostics, i.e. given a large number of possible causes for an outcome, it can correctly identify the most likely cause. The conventional electronic hardware for Bayesian networks and Bayesian inference engines are complex, expensive and consume exorbitant amounts of energy to operate. The goal of this project was to design and analyze powerful Bayesian networks with in-built computing capabilities that are also frugal in their use of energy and have a small footprint. Unconventional Bayesian networks were designed using magnetic devices instead of electronic devices. The basic unit consists of two dipole-coupled magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) of two different geometries. One acts as the parent node and the other the child node of a simple 2-node Bayesian network. MTJs can have two conductance states - high and low which encode the binary bits 0 and 1. The probability of the parent MTJ being in either state can be varied with a current injected into the MTJ, thereby generating a controlled stream of probabilistic bits. The state of the child MTJ is correlated or anti-correlated with the state of the parent owing to dipole coupling between them. The effect of coupling between them can be varied with global strain. That correlates or anti-correlates the probabilistic bits (p-bits) encoded in the resistance states of the two MTJs (the parent and the child) to varying degree (from 0 to 100%). This simple system also acts as a construct for generating conditional probabilities which are required for Bayesian operations. The 2-MTJ system also acts as a programmable synapse having non-reciprocal weights, which can lead to powerful neuromorphic computing. The project completed the design of the 2-MTJ circuit and theoretically demonstrated its ability to function as a Bayesian network and perform specific Bayesian computing tasks.
