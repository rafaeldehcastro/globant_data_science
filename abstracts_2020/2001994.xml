<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project investigates how pressures and circumstances of global production and regional development create contrasting regimes of labor migration within a single society.  Using a strategic case, it examines how a variety of state and non-state actors govern labor migration in relation to global seafood production and regional economic integration initiatives. By examining the link between local processes and wider pressures, the project advances social scientific knowledge of migration governance, the social reproduction of labor, and state influence vis-à-vis regional and global processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data will be collected through participant observation and interviews.  Analysis will be through comparison of two cases of labor migration regimes: (1) a regime of regularization that advances a formal guestworker system in an interior site of seafood production and (2) a regime of flexible containment that maintains flexible and spatially-confined labor in a regionally-linked border zone.  Interviews will be conducted with local officials and workers about practices in each site.  Workers from another industry, origin, and site will be interviewed as well to provide comparison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated contrasting regimes of labor migration in Thailand. Contributing to a larger comparative study of the developmental, regulatory, and reproductive dimensions of these regimes, the project period followed up on policy implementation since previous fieldwork in 2019 and in the new context of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, the Co-PI conducted several in-depth interviews with Thai state officers, migrant workers from Myanmar, employers of migrant workers and representatives of industry associations, documentation brokers and labor recruitment agents, staff of migrant rights organizations, and other actors involved in aspects of labor migration governance. The co-PI conducted these interviews remotely or during field visits to two sites in Thailand &ndash; Samut Sakhon and the Tak border zone &ndash; to follow up on the labor migration situation two years into the COVID-19 pandemic.   Through these activities, the project yielded the following findings:  (a) The Thai state advances subnational regimes of labor migration that differentially govern migrants’ mobility and lives according to global production and development imperatives operating in each site. These regimes vary in terms of their temporal and spatial orientation, with that in Samut Sakhon applying a more pronounced temporal logic to control migrant labor and prevent migrant worker integration in Thai society while that in the Tak border zone uses a more pronounced spatial logic to do the same.  (b) Informal intermediaries are consequential institutions in these regimes: gaps in the state’s guestwork regulatory infrastructure amid heightened coercive policy enforcement create opportunities for documentation brokers to profit by intermediating between migrants, employers, and state offices in ways that can strengthen the state’s ability to document workers but also undermine aspects of policy.  (c) Local governance relations and practices in each site differently shape migrant worker household organization and the means by which they survive and socially reproduce their labor, fostering two distinct structures of migrant labor reproduction &ndash; split reproduction between origin villages and the state/employers in Samut Sakhon and confined reproduction by migrant families and a spatially contained grassroots social infrastructure in the Tak border zone.  (d) The COVID-19 pandemic has created labor shortages resulting from the extended closing of international borders and stalled the government’s plans to enforce an official temporary labor migration system in Thailand (the MOU system) and has necessitated the extension of several types of migrant worker visas and the continuation of ad hoc regulation policies.  These findings contributes to knowledge on migration governance, especially labor migration governance in the global South, with implications for advancing social scientific knowledge on state power, migration and development, and social reproduction more broadly.
