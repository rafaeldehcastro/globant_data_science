<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will be a new instrument to study agents causing human disease and damage to the environment.  This technology enables better studies of viruses and large chemicals for public health and life sciences research. This new capability will also enable the study of interactions between proteins in the body, a critical aspect of many diseases.  In addition, this new instrument can be used for continuous monitoring of drug and vaccine production to ensure high quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed STTR Phase I project focuses on the development of a new type of mass spectrometry, known as distance-of-flight mass spectrometry; and a new detector capable of detecting ultra-high molecular weight ions. Conventional mass spectrometry detectors depend on high-velocity collisions of the target ions on a small area of the detector, releasing an electron from the collision surface for subsequent amplification.  Unfortunately, this strategy of ion detection fails for large ions. The proposed project will incorporate a new type of mass spectrometer that spatially distributes ions along an array of ion charge detectors according to their mass-to-charge ratio.  The approach has no upper mass limit to the ions that can be separated, and thus is an optimum method to determine the mass of large ions.  Further, by detecting the ion charge directly as opposed to the impact event, the new approach is able to detect massive ions.  Having separate detectors arrayed by mass also enables collection of the ions after analysis.  When the new detector is developed and incorporated into the mass spectrometer, the unique capabilities will be demonstrated by analyzing micelles under development as drug delivery vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  This project investigated the core detector technology for a new type of mass spectrometry (MS) instrument based upon Distance-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (DOFMS).  This approach has the unique capability to spatially separate ions of different mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) in such a way that no theoretical upper m/z-limit exist.  Analyzing ultra-high molecular weight molecules are important when studying viruses, intact proteins and protein complexes, or polymer aggregates.        Intellectual Merit: The detector research and development that was conducted enables high-mass MS  as a routine analysis technique.  In order to detect high m/z ions without mass bias, a direct charge-integration detector array system was developed.  Sophisticated charge-detection electronics permits detection of extremely low concentrations of particles, eventually to the single-ion detection level. While this development is intended to create a new type of ion detection system for DOFMS, such technology could eventually find use in other MS platforms.     Broader/Commercial Impact: The applications of high-molecular-weight MS is already being demonstrated in virology, polymer materials chemistry, anti-body:antigen interactions, and large molecule binding, and integrated top-down proteomics.  The commercial development of a new type of instrument will create a market tipping point where the MS analysis of extremely high mass molecules becomes widespread with the availability of appropriate commercial instrumentation.  The ultimate goal of the company is to bring commercial instruments to market in partnership with existing mass spectrometry companies.
