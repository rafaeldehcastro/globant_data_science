<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a high-resolution electron microscope at Wayne State University (WSU) capable of chemical and structural mapping on the nanoscale to advance research being performed by 23 different investigators in the fields of energy conversion/storage, catalysis, microelectronics/sensing, and biomedical sciences. Technological advances arise from the capability of the instrument to provide sub-nanometer imaging and chemical resolution correlated to localized structure. Additionally, the ease-of-use afforded by automated settings and drift correction enables rapid collection of high-quality data (high throughput), even by novice users. The MRI award contributes to the success of WSUâ€™s diverse student body and enhances the urban Detroit community through training of students in modern microscopy and the provision of hands-on educational activities for underserved K-12 students in the city (&gt;80% African American). The electron microscope is managed by the Lumigen Instrument Center core facility with a dedicated microscopist on-staff, enabling research activities and the training of students at six regional academic institutions (five of which are primarily undergraduate institutions) while advancing product and technology development at both start-up and established companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI Award supports the acquisition of a Field-Emission Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (S/TEM) with multiple energy dispersive spectrometers (EDS) and a High Angle Annular Dark Field detector. The S/TEM provides: 1) fast and precise EDS chemical composition mapping and line scanning with spot sizes as low as 0.3 nm and the capability to detect trace elemental components (&lt;0.1 wt.%); 2) Z-contrast imaging capabilities at 0.16 nm resolution for chemical distribution analysis; 3) a large-field, high-speed camera for fast data acquisition; 4) nanobeam diffraction for localized (single particle) structure evaluation; 5) sample drift correction for high-resolution imaging; and 6) remote data acquisition for off-site users. The S/TEM supports research activities focused on (1) the development of doped nanomaterials for high-efficiency magnetic refrigeration; (2) establishment of new high energy-density Li-ion battery technologies; (3) design of electrocatalysts for selective biomass conversion and water splitting (hydrogen generation); (4) fabrication of up-converting nanoparticles for biophotonics/imaging; (5) creation of high-sensitivity chemical sensing platforms for environmental analysis, and (5) Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of electropositive metal films for microelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
