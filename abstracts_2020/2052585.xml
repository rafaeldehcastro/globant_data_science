<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an innovation to reduce freshwater harmful algae blooms (FHABs) resulting from nutrient pollution that threaten aquatic ecosystems and water resources. Conservation of water resources has become a necessity all around the world and the development of new techniques for obtaining and maintaining fresh water is now needed. This innovation will strengthen the U.S. economy, protect human and animal health, and help preserve our nation's freshwater bodies. Furthermore, this technology has applications that increase environmental, social, and economic aspects of sustainability locally, regionally, and globally. Currently, efforts to control FHABs in lakes containing aquatic life has been limited to mechanical cleansing or the use of chemical-based algaecides.  Eutrophication and FHABs are conservatively estimated to cost the U.S. economy 2.2–4.6 billion dollars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a copper-modified natural zeolite (Cu-Z) as an algaecide, a chemical approach that avoids leaving a residual in water and soil as the copper is immobilized within the zeolite matrix. Cu-Z also provides the flexibility of implementing it in different configurations such as filtration units or in-situ static or moving flotation devices. Batch test experiments have been performed in which the efficacy of using Cu-Zeolite has been tested using chlorophyll a as an indicator of algae in water. Also, samples of water containing algae grown in a fish tank, commercially purchased algae, and algae from a local lake have been tested by analyzing for fluorescence levels before and after exposure to copper solutions and Cu-Zeolite.  Preliminary results have shown that the Cu-Zeolite may be as effective as a Copper solution to inhibit algae growth. The use of Cu-Zeolite may provide a safer and cost-effective alternative for preventing algae growth in drinking water storage tanks, pools, and ponds.  Additional studies are being conducted to ensure that the copper residuals in water resulting from the use of the Cu-Zeolite as algaecide are safe for aquatic life or drinking water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

By refining the value proposition through customer interviews, the team was able to identify that the best value for water engineers would be the ability to run the water plant at full capacity without worrying about mechanical problems caused by algae buildup.

The team was also able to calculate an estimated customer value/acquisition cost strengthening the argument for commercialization. By the end of the program, the team completed the business model canvas shown in Figure 3. We were able to validate some of its sections, as shown in the color-coded figure with green representing validation, yellow further validation needed, and red not validated at all.
