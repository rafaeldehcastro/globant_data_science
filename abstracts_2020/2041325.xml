<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: RECONSTRUCTING RATES AND SOURCES OF SEA LEVEL CHANGE OVER THE LAST ~150 THOUSAND YEARS FROM A NEW CORAL DATABASE &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future sea level rise, driven by shrinking land ice and ocean warming, threatens coastal populations, economic activity, infrastructure, and ecosystems around the world. Data on past sea level positions are critical for understanding how sensitive sea level and ice sheets are to temperature change. Paleo-sea level records come from several different sources. For time periods older than about 4000 years, some of the records with the best vertical resolution and most precise ages come from coral reefs, which grow at distinctive elevation ranges with respect to mean sea level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Last Interglacial stage, about 125,000 years ago, global average sea-surface temperature peaked around its current level, while analyses of corals and other proxies indicate global mean sea level peaked about 6-9 m higher than today. This magnitude of sea level rise - implying considerably smaller ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica - hints at the long-term commitment current warming has imparted to future sea level rise. The researchers in this project will use the coral sea level database to better understand rates of sea level and ice-sheet change over time, and how these rates relate to changes in the global climate. The knowledge gained will contribute to work by this team and others in the research community on future sea level projections. The project will provide a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher with interdisciplinary training in oceanography, geology, geophysics and statistics. It will also synthesize a global reconstruction of sea-level over the last 150,000 years, and associated numerical methods for producing this reconstruction, that can be broadly used by the research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on four basic questions: (1) How much did global mean sea level vary over time, and how do local, relative sea levels vary in space, over this time period? (2) How fast did global mean sea level change during the last 150,000 years, and what was the relationship between changes in sea level and changes in temperature? (3) Can the spatial patterns of sea level change be used to separate the contributions of different ice sheets to global mean sea level change? (4) How does global mean sea level reconstructed using corals compare to other continuous records of sea level and climate change? To address these questions, the researchers will: (1) develop emulators of geophysical models of glacio-isostatic adjustment and mantle dynamic topography in order to estimate the contribution of different ice sheets to sea level change, (2) refine the history of seawater uranium isotope compositions that are important to interpreting accurate ages from U-Th-dated corals, and (3) incorporate ecological data about the relationship between coral growth position and sea level into a spatio-temporal statistical framework that links together the coral database and the geophysical models. The application of these techniques to the coral database for the last 150,000 years will provide a uniquely high-precision, continuous record of global mean sea level variability over this time period. This reconstruction will enable a more precise estimate of the magnitude of global mean sea level variability and rates of global mean sea level change, and should allow discrimination between global mean sea level contributions from North American and Arctic sources and those from Antarctic sources. These reconstructions will provide data with which to test the ice sheet models used to project future changes in addition to supporting the career development of a postdoctoral scholar and the training of a Ph.D. student.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to compile sea level data from fossil corals and develop a statistical framework to combine with a geophysical model known as a glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) model to provide a more robust reconstruction of past sea level change.  We succeeded in compiling data from about ~150,000 years ago to present within a database framework that interfaces with existing, online data archives that includes information with respect to the age, the position of sea level, as well as associated metadata.  We have also published some interpreted (screened) versions of the dataset as a resource for the wider community to leverage in assessing and comparing past changes in other climate parameters.  Our data compilation also enabled a reassessment of the uranium isotope composition (234U/238U) of modern seawater as well as past variation in this composition over the last glacial cycle. The 234U/238U composition of seawater is an important parameter that impacts the accuracy of ages interpreted from U-series dating of marine carbonates and also is important in screening data that contributes to the calibration of the radiocarbon timescale, hence this result has a far reaching impact to the wider geochronological community.  The statistical framework that was developed was published an applied to subsets of the data, including some examples where the methods helped to refine projections of future sea level change.    This project contributed directly to the educational training of one graduate student as well as multiple undergraduate and graduate students who assisted with data compilation, interpretation, and publication.  Our interface with existing online data archives also led to the development of data templates and best practices that will be used by the wider community and helped to develop cyberinfrastructure that improves the longevity and utility of coral age-elevation data that are used in sea level reconstructions.   The results of this work have been disseminated via conference presentations, publications of papers and datasets as well as through outreach activities including interfacing with journalists and popular media to convey the results of our work with the general public. We also used the products of this research to interface with related efforts to compile data and interpret past sea level changes, and making both the data and interpretations available to the wider community, in part by ongoing collaborations and interactions with members of two working groups, HOLSEA and PALSEA (supported by INQUA and/or PAGES).
