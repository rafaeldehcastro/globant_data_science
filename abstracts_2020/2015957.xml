<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This research investigates how social change occurs in communities economically dependent on the extraction of natural resources. Social scientists have found that areas with large deposits of natural resources are prone to conflict. Yet, as episodes of conflict garner news attention, less is known about the everyday ways that community members navigate the resource extraction infrastructures (security walls, shipping ports, conveyor belts) with which they live. This project investigates how communities make infrastructure a platform for demanding economic benefits, legal rights, and/or territorial control. It examines if and how these efforts, in turn, effect communitiesâ€™ economic and social wellbeing. Through a focus on extractive infrastructures, this project improves understandings of resources and societal change. In addition to providing training for a graduate student training in methods of scientific data collection and analysis, the findings will be valuable to policy researchers and policy makers interested in conflict resolution and natural resource extraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted in a community facing questions of who controls local natural resources in an effort to qualitatively understand how community members navigate infrastructures. Methods will include participant observation and rigorous documentation of (1) community life, daily work, and activities among these communities and (2) of the corporations carrying out the extraction. The doctoral student will augment these qualitative techniques with extensive formal and informal interviews, oral histories, media analysis, and archival research. By investigating how extractive infrastructure effects community members and how communities, in turn, engage those same infrastructures when demanding socio-economic change, this research generates critical knowledge of social change and conflict in resource rich regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research project, carried out between December 2020 and October 2021 in Western Sahara and Morocco, examines how Sahrawis claim and mobilize the phosphates as a local-global resource to negotiate the violence exercised on them by the Moroccan state. The fieldwork involved research in a political context marked by the return to armed combat from the Saharawi refugee camps and mobility restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic that made entering the militarized city of Laayoune difficult. Research activities included participant observation with local families involved in the phosphates industry either through direct employment or labor union struggles to receive social benefits granted through the Spanish welfare system when they occupied Western Sahara until 1975. In addition, I conducted interviews and oral histories with an extensive range of social and political actors, including phosphates laborers, technicians, unemployed youth, agricultural industrialists, merchants, smugglers, and state authorities. Moreover, activities included daily participant observation and on-the-go interviews with women in intimate living spaces, thereby informing the research with insights from spaces off-limits to researchers in this area.
