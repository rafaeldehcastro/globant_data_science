<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corp project will result in the ability to decrease vein movement during venipuncture. In situations in which a patient requires intravenous (IV) fluids, this device could reduce the time it takes to successfully insert a needle by stabilizing the vein for a faster insertion time. This device has a reduced cost in comparison to vein tracking systems which could save hospitals money. This technology also has the potential to reduce the number of specialty staff needed for needle insertion and may reduce the human and financial burdens associated with venipuncture complications, including hematomas, injury, wounds, anxiety, hypertension, and infections, especially for at-risk patients, such as those who are elderly, diabetic, or immunocompromised. There are currently over 6,000 hospitals in the US alone. All hospitals perform venipuncture through intravenous therapy insertions or taking blood samples, with over 230 million IVs placed every year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on constructing a method for stabilizing veins during the venipuncture procedure. The technology is a single-use plastic device that is placed on the forearm of a patient by a medical professional. A slight pressure is applied on the device into and up the arm in order to isolate and elevate the vein in preparation for needle insertion. The device aims to immobilize the vein to reduce the complications associated with the phenomena known as "rolling veins" in which the vein moves and can result in an unsuccessful needle insertion. A model vein was created in order to test the movement of the vein both with and without the device. The testing showed that the device decreased the maximum displacement of the vein by 84% in comparison to tested vein displacement without the device. The maximum displacement of the vein with the device was calculated to be 0.20 mm while the maximum displacement of the vein without the device was calculated to be 1.26 mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
