<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in drastic socioeconomic, educational, political and cultural impacts worldwide. Despite the measures currently undertaken, the latest projections of COVID-19 death toll range upwards of 100,000 across the U.S. The World Health Organization considers the main route of COVID-19 transmission to be through contact with surfaces that have been contaminated with small respiratory droplets that are released when COVID-19 patients cough or exhale. The virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) retains infectivity on stainless steel surfaces for up to 72 hours, and the current absence of a vaccine and effective antiviral drugs makes it critical to explore novel approaches to breaking the chain of viral transmission.  The project focuses on design and initial laboratory and field testing of a spray coating technology that can be applied to a variety of surfaces to both repel virus-laden droplets and photocatalytically deactivate viral pathogens that lodge on coated surfaces.  More broadly, the project supports graduate and undergraduate training in the areas of surface coating technology and catalysis, and also engages local hospitals and university medical research facilities in assessing the efficacy of the coating technologies for combating a broad range of airborne pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research investigates the pathogen inhibiting efficacy of superhydrophobic and photocatalytic antimicrobial (SPA) coatings, a group of sprayable materials which, through their combined modes of action, can confer self-disinfecting properties to a wide array of surfaces, such as metals, concrete, ceramics, glass, and wood, to help prevent the transmission of viral, bacterial, and other pathogens for a prolonged duration of time, ranging from several months to several years.  The SPA coatings represent a novel two-pronged approach to repelling and deactivating viral pathogens.  The coatings consist of nano-TiO2 and ZnO siloxane-modified superhydrophobic layers that serve to repel respiratory droplets, thus minimizing the ability of pathogens to linger on surfaces, while also facilitating cleaning procedures. The superhydrophobic layers are intermixed with TiO2, ZnO, and Ti-phosphate layers that impart photocatalytic activity.  The photocatalytic material has potential to deactivate any pathogens that remain on the surface through the release of hydroxyl radicals. Doping of the materials with cuprous compounds further enhances the antimicrobial effect. Efficacy against the COVID-19 virus is the primary justification for the urgency of the research, which will proceed in parallel via both lab and field testing.  Beyond the immediate impact on the current pandemic, the resulting technology will improve our nationâ€™s preparedness for future waves of the same virus or other airborne pathogens.  In addition, data obtained during the current pandemic will provide a fast track to scale-up, manufacturing and widespread deployment of the anti-viral coatings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to ENG and MPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted the economy, society, and education of populations worldwide. One of the most immediate and pressing challenges has been the need for medically sound, sterile environments for the isolation and convalescence of affected individuals demanding flexible and rapid deployment of dedicated medical facilities and quarantine accommodations. The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the extent of societyâ€™s susceptibility to infectious diseases and the devastating cost of under-preparedness for a public health crisis of this magnitude.

Traditional methods of maintaining sanitary surfaces require regular cleaning with antiseptic solutions, leading to substantial spending on materials and personnel time. Superhydrophobic and photocatalytic antimicrobial (SPA) coatings developed with NSF RAPID support by a multidisciplinary research team from UW-Milwaukee address the unmet need for effortless and reliable self-disinfection of surfaces that can serve without the need for frequent re-application.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT  The SPA coating technology is a unique concept proposed by the PIs, which combines the previous experience of the UW-Milwaukee research team with superhydrophobic modification using ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles and nanofibers that possess a robust antibacterial potential due to photocatalytic effect. It was envisioned that the combination of all these added-value features: antiviral, antibacterial, photocatalytic, and superhydrophobic properties in proposed SPA coatings can address the urgent need for rapid disinfection of public places.  The data gathered from the utilization of "self-disinfecting" building materials were fundamentally unique in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. This project demonstrated that developed SPA coatings are:  &#9679;             Inexpensive and fast to produce;  &#9679;             Easily applied in a manner similar to that of conventional spray paint;  &#9679;             Capable of forming texturized ceramic surfaces and chemically binding hydrophobic polysiloxanes;  &#9679;             Capable of providing over- and superhydrophobic properties;  &#9679;             Capable of forming an impermeable water barrier eliminating water transport through treated surfaces;  &#9679;             Effective on a variety of materials, including metals, concrete, ceramics;  &#9679;             Capable of photocatalytic activity under natural and artificial light;  &#9679;             Capable of demonstrating room-temperature photoluminescence;  &#9679;             Capable of photodegrading of organic compounds and antimicrobial effects;  &#9679;             Capable of enhancing corrosion protection properties.  BROADER IMPACT AND EDUCATION  This research provided substantial evidence of the performance of the novel superhydrophobic and photocatalytic antimicrobial solutions.
