<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The goal of this doctoral dissertation project is to study the development and expression of social identity in past rural social groups during times of social, religious, and political uncertainty. Previous scholarship on this topic has focused on the role of empires and social identity in shaping urbanism, material culture, economy, and local environment. However, the relationship  between rural and urban sites in the past is generally poorly understood. Better understanding of how remote social groups negotiated and expressed their identity during turbulent times can not only help understand the social landscape of historic areas but also understand social group identity maintenance in the present day rapidly globalizing world. How does one "read" or understand expressions of social identity among ethnic groups as they occupy new regions, such as in the context of global refugee crises? Increased understanding of this topic holds potential for economy, politics, NGOs, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research asks if it is possible learn about the social identity of those who produced an overlooked type of decorated pottery by studying the development, change, or continuity of the pottery over time and geography. Can one discern social signaling in their intentionally decorated pottery? What are the messages and who are the audiences? Archaeology and material cultural analysis tempered with social theory are important inroads towards understanding the people who made the pottery, especially in the framework a large and diverse collection of pottery from carefully excavated and recorded stratigraphic contexts. The research will be conducted on hand-formed painted pottery at museums and archaeological collections, which will then be compared to an already-analyzed assemblage of similar pottery from an archaeological site located in a region remote from major urban centers, yet on an important trade route. Combining data from archaeological sites, museums, and collections, this research will produce a dataset that will highlight the importance of vernacular hand-formed pottery. The researcher will apply material cultural analyses to critically address the large dataset this work will produce. The project will develop upon new material culture analytical methods while applying social network and statistical analysis to conduct comparative analyses groups in order to understand how similarities and differences in forming and decoration can reveal group expressions and affiliations at the local and regional scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Past scholarship on this region has focused on the development of lowland urbanism and agriculture, yet little is known of the highland communities that framed this area from the east.

Work began at TBK &nbsp;in 2015 with excavations that produced a large corpus of cultural material. Recovered artifacts and ecofacts have been associated with AMS/14c dated contexts across the site, allowing researchers to create a chronology that shows the site's endurance across three periods of political rule ?the Abbasid (750-~870 CE in Central Asia), the Samanid (870-999 CE), and the Qarakhanid (840-1212 CE). The following analysis focuses on pottery from cultural contexts attributed to the Qarakhanid period, which contain large amounts of a ceramic type that has been termed hand-formed slip-painted pottery (HSPP) as a result from this work.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The TBK ceramic assemblage consists of over 9,000 pottery fragments and vessels, 76% of which is hand-formed and undecorated, while 18% is HSPP. Six percent of the assemblage is wheel thrown, with less than 1% glazed. These numbers are remarkable in that they are an almost perfect inverse of assemblages from contemporary lowland environments. Urban pottery assemblages typically feature wheel thrown pottery, with few hand-formed types. The large amount of HSPP at TBK is unique, and while it is rarely mentioned in scholarship, the complex designs that were used for its decoration at TBK and across highland communities show networks of decoration and distinctive voices of expression that persisted during this period of political and social change.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decoration is often interpreted as a means of communicating messages. Peeples (2018) presents categorical identity (membership in large entities such as political groups, kin groups, or religions) and demonstrates its repeated use and representation via high-visibility decoration and form, or signals. High-visibility decoration reflects networks of social signaling and is often interpreted as a proxy for categorical identity. When interpreted as signals intended for public view and communication, the high-visibility attributes of HSPP show membership in communities of decorative and formal practices that linked locations across mountains using visual signals that were easily duplicated and that were meant to be seen by an audience. HSPP decoration shows a trend of locally produced, non-standardized vessel forms, and a common language of decoration that spans mountain ranges.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HSPP vessels are completely unstandardized in form, which speaks to local-scale production, and are small on average, which suggests temporary use and/or transportability typical of the pottery of nomadic groups. HSPP slip is almost always rust-red, and likely derived from iron-ore that is abundant in the mountains of Central Asia. The decoration is typically ?all-over? but is sometimes oriented around a central medallion. In the tenth century, triangles, spirals, and solar symbols were common in the north, while in the east the most common patterns were spirals, marquee-like motifs, and trees. Simultaneously to the west designs were typically organic, representing flowers, solar symbols, and trees. To the south-east, patterns featured zigzags, plant shoots with curls, spirals, meanders, stars, and herringbone. In the geographic center of all this, at TBK HSPP featured a variety of all these motifs, as well as dots, crosshatch, and marquee designs. This demonstrates variety in HSPP vessel decoration across the region, but not in the expressive vocabulary.
