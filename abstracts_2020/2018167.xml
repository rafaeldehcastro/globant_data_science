<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[With this award funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Case Western Reserve University will acquire a variable pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The instrument features detectors and stages integrated with external stimuli that will enable in-operando studies of the evolution of materials, devices, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). This instrument will enhance the research and teaching capabilities across CWRU, and provide a unique resource to the surrounding research community. This instrument will be located in a general user facility, with training and service work managed by highly qualified staff. Users from across Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, and the School of Medicine can explore the fundamental materials science necessary to understand and improve devices ranging from batteries to high-temperature sensors and actuators to thin-film solar cells. The proposed instrument will enhance the student learning experience by giving students access to contemporary imaging techniques useful for research and development across all material systems. In particular, the variable pressure chamber of the proposed instrument reduces the sample preparation needed to characterize insulators, thus allowing undergraduate students to focus on the learning objective of the laboratory course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equipment provides a method to directly observe dynamic mechanisms for the development of models of behaviors and advance our scientific understanding in a broad range of materials research problems. Such unprecedented experiments will lead to new fundamental insights for the development and testing of mechanistically-informed theories, and from them, new design rules and guidelines for rational engineering of materials and devices. In particular, it will enable mechanisms of interface evolution in optoelectronic devices; electrochemical reactions; and microstructural evolution under elevated-temperature conditions in material systems for energy generation. The capability to image insulator material without conductive coating provides a new opportunity to the CWRU materials research community, to explore mechanisms of material synthesis and microstructural evolution that are not currently possible with existing SEM equipment. In particular, understanding how the interfaces of layered and architectured polymer materials control lifetime performance for optoelectronic and energy storage applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The availability of such an instrument supports the research and educational careers of a broad range of users including student researchers across the CWRU campus and beyond, and the R&amp;D efforts of local non-profits and industrial clients. The instrument was installed and we began training new users in June of 2021. Since then, the instrument has been booked for 1080 sessions, for an average of 2.1 hrs, by 144 internal users and 35 external users from 9 different non-profit organizations and 15 different for-profit companies. It has become an integral component of the experiential learning opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in seven classes in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and one class in the Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences. The capability to image insulator material without conductive coating has provided new opportunities to explore mechanisms of material synthesis and microstructural evolution that were not possible with our previous SEM equipment. SCSAM Executive Director, Jeffrey Pigott, collaborated with the Conservation Department at the Cleveland Museum of Art to leverage many of the Apreo capabilities such as low kV secondary electron imaging, backscattered electron imaging, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and cathodoluminescence imaging under low vacuum conditions to aid in diagnosing degradation and guiding conservation efforts on a variety of pieces from the CMA collection such as a multi-year restoration effort on a 17th-century Italian painting, delamination of paint layers from an outdoor sculpture, chemical identification of Central American pendants from pre-1500 and fibers from a 17th-century French tapestry. Additionally, the electrochemical stage is allowing researchers to gain insight into the mechanism of electrochemical performance of nanostructured metal/metal oxide materials that are applicable for in-vivo glucose sensing. Based on survey results of the academic user-base, the instrument was utilized to advance the science presented in at least six publications, and over 15 conference proceedings. In addition to supporting the academic user community, the instrument purchased in this program has enabled us to engage with industrial collaborators through an open-house event focused on materials manufacturing in Northeast Ohio, and a continuing education event for the Polymer manufacturing community in Northeast Ohio.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/03/2023<br>      Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;W&nbsp;Carter</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018167/2018167_10690256_1695240156092_210427_CWRU_Engineering_Lab_19_HIGHRES--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018167/2018167_10690256_1695240156092_210427_CWRU_Engineering_Lab_19_HIGHRES--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Researcher at the Apreo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018167/2018167_10690256_1695240156092_210427_CWRU_Engineering_Lab_19_HIGHRES--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Researcher at the Apreo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student Researcher putting sample in the Apreo for Analysis</div> <div class="imageCredit">CWRU marketing</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jennifer&nbsp;W&nbsp;Carter</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Researcher at the Apreo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
