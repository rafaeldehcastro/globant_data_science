<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Under this award a new full-waveform inversion method will be developed for the identification of the seismic input motion on the truncation surface of a computational domain, using existing sparse seismic records. This new method will allow engineers to reconstruct the spatial and temporal distribution of the seismic input motion, without the need to resort to the reconstruction of the seismic event at the hypocenter, as is typically the case. Then, by using the reconstructed seismic motion, it will be possible to study the effect of an earthquake on the built environment, including subsurface systems (soil, foundations, and underground structures). Therefore, the method will serve as a tool to assess holistically the impact of earthquakes on the built environment during seismic events. The proposed research will present the mathematical and computational modeling of the new seismic-input identification method, as well as numerical results showing the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the method. The computer code, input data, and tutorials, necessary for using the new seismic-input identification method, will be disseminated through the DesignSafe Cyberinfrastructure. These materials will help informed users to easily follow the research and extend it. Participating graduate students will gain broad knowledge and experience on wave propagation analyses and inverse problems. Moreover, hands-on projects will be used to motivate high school students, from underrepresented groups, to pursue STEM careers during the planned outreach program ``How do waves work?: watch, feel, and analyze waves??.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, there has been no robust numerical method that can identify complex, incoherent seismic input motions in a solid, truncated by a wave-absorbing boundary. Existing methods are limited to either simplified deconvolution techniques or large-scale seismic-source inversion approaches that can identify the seismic source parameters (however simple or complicated the adopted seismic source model may be) at the hypocenter. However, there are many complexities, inaccuracies, and uncertainties associated with the large-scale inversion approach that render it impractical for near-surface simulations. It is the aim of this research to bypass the complexities associated with the large-scale seismic source inversion by targeting the seismic-motion reconstruction near the surface. Specifically, this research will focus on the reconstruction of effective seismic input motion at the Domain Reduction Method (DRM) boundary, using a partial differential equation-constrained optimization method. The semi-infinite extent of the computational domain will be truncated by using Perfectly-Matched-Layers, and state and adjoint wave equations will be solved using the finite element method. The new seismic-input identification method will be the most accurate and efficient method for inferring seismic input motions in soil-structure systems. This method can accommodate arbitrary soil heterogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary: In the area of earthquake engineering, there is a need to relate measured seismic data to ground motions and structural responses in a near-surface domain of interest during an earthquake event. By doing so, engineers can identify the locations where responses of large amplitudes took place during a seismic event and investigate the impact of earthquakes on critical structures, including subsurface systems (foundations and underground structures), and their surrounding soils. Therefore, such a method can contribute to examining the weak points (e.g., possible locations of structural failures) of critical infrastructure shortly after a seismic event, and, thus, making it possible to judge whether the infrastructure is structurally sound to reuse after the earthquake. The important step in the method is to estimate the characteristics of incoming waves hitting the infrastructure from measured seismic data from sensors.  To date, there have been two dominant, conventional methods for the identification of incoming seismic waves that hit a near-surface domain. One is deconvolution in a one-dimensional (1D) setting, and the other is the identification of a seismic source profile at a fault in a very large (e.g., hundreds of kilometers long) regional-scale domain. However, deconvolution is not applicable to a site where incoming waves do not propagate in a vertical direction, and the computational cost of the large-scale source inversion is prohibitively large.  As an alternative to the aforementioned conventional methods, this project investigates a new numerical method to identify arbitrary, complex incoming seismic waves and reconstruct corresponding wave responses in a truncated multi-dimensional domain by using sparsely measured ground motion data.  Intellectual Merit: This work transforms the paradigm of inverse problems associated with elastodynamics, where the most of the problems have been focused on identifying the material properties of a domain using a known wave source (e.g., a point wave source on the top free surface), into a new class of an inverse problem, where unknown complex incoming waves are identified. This research will also transform the practice of earthquake engineering such that engineers can turn big data of seismic measurement from ubiquitous modern sensors around critical (infra)structures into knowledge about the dynamic responses of the structures and surrounding soils during a real seismic event.  The problem is formulated as an inverse-source problem, and this work has resulted in 4 published/accepted journal papers, 4 journal manuscripts under review, and 1 journal manuscript in preparation in the area of such a new inverse problem as of June 2022. The key findings shown in the journal papers include the following.  The new numerical method, resulted from this work, enables the identification of seismic effective force, which is equivalent to incoming seismic waves, at a domain reduction method boundary in a reduced domain.  The wave responses induced by a reconstructed seismic effective force match their targeted counterparts.  The desired sensor spacing to accurately reconstruct targeted wave responses depends on a wavelength. Namely, the smaller wavelength necessitates the smaller sensor spacing in the presented method.    Broader Impacts: The presented method can be used by earthquake engineers to replay the ground motions and structural responses in a near-surface domain caused by an earthquake in a fine resolution over space and time. Namely, sensors (e.g., accelerometers, vision sensors, or optical cables) can measure the vibrational motions around an infrastructure under consideration.
