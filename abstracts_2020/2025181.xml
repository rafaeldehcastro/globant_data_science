<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This two-year project will analyze how adolescent girls develop as sustainable citizens as they take part in a college-based STEM summer program that offers hands-on workshops in sustainability science. As a Building Capacity in STEM Educational Research (BCSER) project, a key goal is to build the principal investigator's knowledge base and analytical expertise in STEM education research. This project aims to position the investigator to conduct longer-term research on broadening participation in sustainability science and ways to prepare the next generation of STEM educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situated in the context of a Philadelphia-based partnership between Drexel University and the girls-only Eureka STEM program, the project has potential to broaden participation among underrepresented girls from low-income, minority communities and advance understanding of sustainable literacy among middle school girls. Moreover, by examining the structure and impact of continuous and intentional learning pathways through girls’ middle school years, the project can advance understanding of how informal learning environments support girls’ interest and confidence in STEM. In this way, the project offers a roadmap for how to foster effective informal education interventions to create more inclusive and diverse learning environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research question driving this project is: Can STEM content that is focused on inquiry-based activities that build towards a community organized sustainability project offer a means to cultivate a sense of sustainable citizenship and environmental civic action?  It uses ethnographic methods to identify and evaluate the informal STEM learning environment and to infer the contexts and frameworks in which girls develop their interest and confidence. During the two years, middle school girls will enroll in the Eureka STEM program for four weeks during the summer and one day every month during the academic year. The girls will be introduced to socially relevant real-world problems through multidisciplinary engineering and science hands-on active-learning workshops that can be iteratively solved using fundamental engineering and science methods and tools. Through a series of interactive augmented exercises, the girls will engage in sustainability exercises, facilitated by students and faculty from Drexel STEM departments. Drexel graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in STEM pedagogy and teaching strategies through coursework and participation in the Eureka program. The goal is to support girls’ creation of environmental civic action plans that engage the communities in which the girls live and that offer a means to operationalize their sustainability interests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is supported through the EHR Core Research: Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) competition that is designed to build individuals’ capacity to carry out high quality fundamental STEM education research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cultivating Sustainable Citizenship focused on addressing environmental sustainability as a shared human concern and responsibility, recognizing the global challenges of environmental degradation. It aimed to prepare today's youth to face these environmental issues by cultivating their understanding of sustainability processes, sustainable citizenship, and environmental civic action. The project was motivated by the increasing importance of sustainability science and activism, particularly in the face of climate change's impacts on the environment, energy, food security, and public health.  The research explored how middle school girls perceived themselves as sustainable citizens while participating in inquiry-based experiential environmental science activities. Over a span of two years, a girls-only STEM summer program was closely examined to understand how sustainable citizenship was formed and to identify effective activities and projects for nurturing environmental civic action among eighth and ninth-grade girls. This research aimed to connect students across different learning domains, from knowledge-building workshops on a college campus to active engagement within their community.  The major goals of the project were as follows:  Conduct a 2-year study of a girls-only STEM summer program, to examine how sustainable citizenship is formed, and to identify activities and projects that are effective in cultivating environmental civic action among eighth and ninth-grade girls. To design multifaceted assessment tools that can be used to examine the multiple learning outcomes of Eureka and similar engineering education programs. To engage in professional development designed to build PI and institutional knowledge base and analytical expertise in STEM education research and focus on how sustainable citizenship and environmental civic action are cultivated among girls in informal learning programs, using the target summer program as the context.      The major goals of the project were accomplished in the project timeframe. The research study facilitated the development of two modified survey assessment tools that were administered in a longitudinal panel design over two concurrent summers. These custom assessment tools, developed with the assistance of an external evaluator, allowed the researcher to track measurable changes in the study participant’s attitudes and ideas over time. In utilizing these assessment tools, the researcher was able to identify particularly impactful curricular and programmatic elements that facilitated the development of participants’ identities as "sustainable citizens." On an institutional scale, this project facilitated partnerships between two separate colleges and one museum contained within the university system. Additionally, results from this project have been presented at multiple national conferences over the past 24 months.
