<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a low-cost and energy-efficient conversion of mixed waste plastics into an intermediate product that the petrochemical industry can convert into new polymer resin. This new technology will revolutionize the plastics recycling industry and will allow for closed-loop plastic material flows.  The process technology will improve recycling of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) plastics from materials recovery facilities (MRFs), significant because PE and PP comprise over 50% of global plastics production and post-consumer waste generation.  The proposed process is modular and small footprint so that it may be deployed over a wide range of scales to serve municipalities of various population sizes. The products from this process may be of great interest to petrochemical firms who are seeking solutions to recycling and a circular economy for plastics.  This project will explore translation to help municipalities, counties, and states achieve higher mandated recycle rates for PE and PP plastics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel waste plastics recycling process that will enable a circular economy for olefin plastics, polyethylene and polypropylene, and contribute to the solution of the global waste plastics problem. The design of the proposed technology combines multiple functions into each process unit, increasing energy efficiency and cost savings. The technology is based on rapid conversion at elevated temperature in a reactor with precise control over the molecular conversion mechanisms. In addition, the process may generate a range of chemical products, such as monomers, aromatic intermediates, and fuel-range liquid products substituting for petroleum naphtha, diesel, jet, and gasoline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As part of the NSF I-Corp project, due to COVID-19 protocols we remotely interviewed over 100 leaders in the waste plastics supply chain to understand the market opportunity of waste plastics pyrolysis.&nbsp;These interviews also revealed that MRFs produce significant quantities of mixed plastics bales that currently have no markets in recycling, and are therefore landfilled or incinerated. If pyrolysis could process mixed plastic bales, there would be a market fit if the economics are favorable.
