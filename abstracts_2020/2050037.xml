<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The primary goal of this project is to explore connections between the dynamical theory of polynomials and rational functions of one variable and the theory of Diophantine geometry which studies arithmetic features of solutions to polynomial equations. Specifically, the principal investigator studies bifurcations and stability within algebraic families of these dynamical systems defined over the field of complex numbers and uses the results to address questions about height functions and rational points on arithmetic varieties, focused on intersection theory and counting problems.  Even the simplest families of examples, such as the well-studied family of quadratic polynomials, exhibit complicated dynamical features that we have yet to understand.  Similarly, there remain deep unanswered questions about the seemingly simple structure of torsion points on elliptic curves. This research combines methods from both complex analysis and arithmetic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator with her collaborators has developed new methods of proof incorporating tools from complex dynamics and non-archimedean analysis.  The main objective of this project is to exploit these combined methods to address problems about height functions and some new problems about the dynamics of maps on the Riemann sphere, inspired by the arithmetic questions. The principal investigator is working towards:  (1) uniform versions of Unlikely Intersection problems about algebraic dynamical systems; (2) a study of torsion points within a family of abelian varieties, to characterize which curves can intersect many points of ''small'' canonical height; (3) the Critical Orbit Conjecture, about the geometry of postcritically finite maps within the moduli space of rational maps; (4) the conjectured rationality of canonical heights for dynamical systems over function fields in characteristic zero, and connections to transcendence problems; and (5) equidistribution statements for families of maps and for families of elliptic curves.  This research should have impact on multiple areas of mathematics, including number theory, geometry, and dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this project was to explore connections between the theory of complex dynamical systems and the geometry and arithmetic of solutions to polynomial equations having integer or rational coefficients.  On the dynamical side -- especially in the study of iteration of rational functions (Julia sets, bifurcations, the Mandelbrot set) but originating in the mathematical study of planetary motion -- the first connections to number theory were observed about 100 years ago.  On the arithmetic side, it was probably the 1960s when dynamical ideas were first used as tools to understand the arithmetic geometry of elliptic curves and higher-dimensional varieties.  The goal of the project was to develop these relationships and discover new aspects.     The specific problems and questions addressed by this project exploited dynamical properties, such as stability in families and and distributions of orbits, to answer questions about Diophantine equations that had eluded number theorists for decades.  And conversely, discoveries were made that allowed for additional techniques from the broader field of arithmetic geometry to explain subtle dynamical features in orbits of simple-looking algebraic dynamical systems.     Among the most significant results obtained with support of this grant:  (1) In a collaboration with Krieger and Ye, the PI studied the geometry of algebraic curves embedded into their Jacobians, to understand the precise conditions that allow a curve to intersect the subgroups of the Jacobian.  They proved, using a relation between dynamical systems on the Riemann sphere and a family of genus 2 curves, a uniform bound on the number of torsion points that can lie on these curves.  Most importantly, the bound was independent of the field of definition of the curve.  (2) Using surprisingly similar methods to (1) in a seemingly unrelated setting, the PI, again together with Krieger and Ye, analyzed the geometry of periodic points and orbits for certain polynomial dynamical systems, and they provided uniform bounds on the number of such points that can be periodic for two distinct systems.  (3) In an ongoing collaboration with Mavraki, the PI has been studying families of elliptic curves in parallel with families of dynamical systems on the Riemann sphere, developing the intersection theory for analyzing the geometry both of subgroups and of periodic orbits simultaneously, leading to new proofs of results about elliptic curves and abelian varieties and resolving existing open questions about dynamics in complex dimensions 1 and 2.     The results supported by this grant are published in peer-reviewed journals. The articles are also freely and publicly available in their preprint form.  To share these results in detail, the PI gave regular lectures in seminars, departmental colloquia, and conferences around the United States and the world.   Broader Impact.
