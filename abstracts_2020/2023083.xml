<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Space Weather Workshop is an inter-governmental agency sponsored meeting to bring together industry, academic, and government professionals for discussion of space weather. The aim of workshop is to discuss space weather impacts on communications, navigation, spacecraft operation, aviation, and electric power and identify what the highest priority operational needs are regarding these topics. The workshop fosters communication among researchers, space weather service providers, and users of space weather services. The proposal is to support administrative costs and student registration and housing for 17 students for the Space Weather Workshop to be held in Boulder, Colorado from April 20-24, 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
