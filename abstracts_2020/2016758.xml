<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The Engineering Biology Research Consortium (EBRC) aims to produce a roadmap for the advancement of materials from engineering biology, to be published in Summer 2020. The goal of the roadmap is to serve as a resource for the research community, to spur creativity and promote significant advancement and innovation over the next 20 years. This roadmap will be focused on the engineering of biology to produce, augment, and improve materials for a broad swath of applications. The roadmap will consist of technical and application challenges, innovative technical goals, and concrete but ambitious milestones for tool and technology development that build a path toward achieving the goals and overcoming the challenges. Creating a successful roadmap consists of a synergistic process of structured scoping, drafting, discussion, review, and revision of material. EBRC accomplishes this, in part, through writing workshops with the research community and stakeholders. These workshops are an invaluable part of achieving a roadmap that represents the diverse views of researchers and those that support future research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;To support the production of a materials roadmap for engineering biology, EBRC seeks financial support for two, 2-day writing workshops. Of particular importance in producing a materials roadmap is the engagement of a diverse group of scientists and engineers from the materials research community, who may or may not have experience or expertise in engineering biology. These individuals encourage a holistic approach to understanding and reporting the unique challenges of producing usable, effective, and functional materials, and will be enlisted as workshop participants, draft contributors, and community reviewers. Past EBRC writing workshops have proven to be incredibly productive in bringing together experts and stakeholders to draft, review, and revise the roadmap content and substance. Financial support will help to cover costs of participant travel, accommodations, meals and expenses and any necessary facility and support fees. EBRC workshops are designed to be accessible and are held on dates and in locations that serve as many participants as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
