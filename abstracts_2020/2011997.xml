<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea. In a fraction of a second on September 14, 2015, the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics was born with the detection by the LIGO instruments of two black holes colliding over a billion lightyears away. Less than two years later, over the span of 12 hours on August 17, 2017, the field of gravitational- wave multi-messenger astronomy was born with the detection of both gravitational-waves and light from the collision of two neutron stars. Over the next years many additional collisions will be detected, and this project will explore what these sources will teach us about physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The project focuses on learning about how the distribution of the masses of the detected systems help us understand how the Universe makes black holes and neutron stars. This relates to how the Universe makes stars, which in turn relates to how the universe makes the elements which are crucial to life. In addition to exploring these fascinating questions and publishing results to help move the field forward, the group will also perform extensive education and outreach activities related to gravitational-waves and black holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will analyze the source catalogs and determine underlying population distributions. The PI will examine the mass distribution of the component compact objects in the detected binaries. In particular, the PI will explore both the putative lower mass gap (between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole), as well as the upper mass gap (a dearth of black holes of mass 50 solar masses ). Similarly, the PI will explore the spin and mass ratio distributions of the population, as well as the redshift evolution of all of these distributions. Characterizing these distributions, and their evolution, will teach us about the formation and evolution of black holes and neutron stars, as well as binaries that contain them. As our understanding of the distributions improves, the ability to characterize outliers from these underlying distributions also improves. The PI will further study this process, both highlighting the nature of outliers, as well as developing population-based parameter estimation. Furthermore, the PI will study associated astrophysical constraints based on these distributions, including forward modeling of these detections using population synthesis, and machine learning approaches to the equation of state of neutron stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NSF-funded LIGO collaboration performed the first direct detection of gravitational waves seven years ago. In the intervening time, the catalog of sources has grown by leaps and bounds, from one to three, then 11, then over 40, and now close to 90. With so many binary black hole binaries, as well as binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole mergers, we are now able to learn entirely new things about how the Universe makes these extreme systems. Over the course of this project we have developed entirely new ways to analyze this data. For example, we have discovered that just the GW data, alone, provides evidence that there are two categories of extreme compact objects: black holes and neutron stars. This is because of a clear feature in the distribution of black hole masses. We have also developed a formalism to measure properties of the densest forms of matter by studying neutron stars. And we have shown that the host galaxies to binary neutron stars can provide important infromation about the ages and properties of these events, and thereby help us figure out how binary neturon stars are made and how they evolve. We have also shown that the multiple imaging of gravitational-wave sources results in waveforms that appear to break general relativity. If you didn't realize that this was true, you might observe a binary black hoel and conclude that Einstein was wrong, when in fact his theory is (thus far) in perfect agreement with all observations. We also have pointed out that there potentially exists a population of large black holes, well over 100 times the mass of the Sun each, that might be detected in the coming years. This population is of particular interest, not only for what it would teach us about how black holes are made, but also as a potentially powerfull cosmological probe. As part of this project, we have also run a Warrior Scholar Project STEM week for veterans transitioning to academia. We provided lectures and classes and hands-on (virtual) labs, both to provide a grounding but also to help build confidence and provide tools for success in college.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/24/2022<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;Holz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
