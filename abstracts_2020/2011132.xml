<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS) comprises 53 national operations research societies arranged in four regional groups (North America, Latin America, Asia/Pacific, and Europe).  IFORS' purpose is “the development of operational research as a unified science and its advancement in all nations of the world.”  IFORS sponsors a triennial conference held at different locations across the globe.  These conferences draw a worldwide audience and provide an important venue to highlight developments in operations research, particularly in developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 22nd IFORS conference is to be held from June 21-26, 2020, in Seoul, South Korea.  This award will provide support for four researchers from underrepresented groups to participate as Keynote Speakers. Keynote  Speakers  are  invited on the basis of their substantial contributions to the field and their ability to inspire and educate participants from around the world.  They are given the opportunity to give a full-length hour long talk and are featured prominently in the scientific program of the conference.  This award supports the National Science Foundation's desire to broaden participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematical fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
