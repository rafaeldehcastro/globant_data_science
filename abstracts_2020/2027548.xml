<AbstractNarration>The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has hit countries around the world hard and is likely to have both short-run and long-run impacts on health behaviors, social norms, and trust in government and other organizations. In the short run, governments and health organizations provide extensive information and recommend behavior to avoid contracting the disease and spreading it to others. This research involves surveys to figure out whether and to what extent people follow recommendations and change behavior. Because the research team has been following a sample of university students for several years, the team already knows a lot about them, and this facilitates an understanding of variation in compliance with recommendations. For example, risk-tolerance and trust in organizations are likely to matter. The team is exploring how people process information about the virus, and how that affects their beliefs about the risks to themselves and others. The researchers also are examining the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on social norms, and how those change over time. The second wave of the study looks for longer run impacts. The results of this study will be useful in shaping future policies and communications about health risks, especially during epidemics and other health crises.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The researchers make use of previous samples of subjects to test the impact of COVID-19 information and recommendations on behavior, social norms, trust in each other and institutions, and risk-tolerance. They have four areas of study. The first is how people process “noisy” information in the context of COVID-19. Prior research by a team member has shown that some individuals tend to misunderstand such information to their benefit. The teams adapt the methodology and protocol of the prior work to examine how individuals interpret COVID-19 information, and how this affects their beliefs about their own vulnerabilities. Second, the team studies the impact of COVID-19 on norms of behavior, including those directly related to the virus (social distancing, hand-washing), as well as norms of trust, sharing and in-group favoritism that may be shifting or newly emerging in response to COVID19. Prior work by a team member developed a methodology for eliciting social norms, and has shown that norms evolve in response to social influence. Third, they explore the impact of COVID-19 on interpersonal trust and trust in institutions, which significantly impacts willingness to follow government and organizational recommendations. Prior work by team members used incentivized games and surveys to study trust and reciprocity in natural disaster settings. Finally, they look at risk perception and risk taking related to COVID-19. Using incentivized measures of risk tolerance, and survey measures of domain-specific risk perceptions and behavior, the team explores the relationship between risk aversion and behavior, but also how the advent of COVID-19 has changed preferences for risk-taking. In these ways prior knowledge about the subjects provides an opportunity to study the impact of a national health catastrophe on information processing, social norms, trust and reciprocity and risk-taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes report: The major goal of the project is to examine the potential impact of stereotype threat on student performance at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs). It also studies the impacts of these findings and will allow us to make policy recommendations. Stereotype threat is defined as the fear of confirming negative stereotypes about one’s group.  This fear has been shown to significantly affect performance, particularly on high-importance exams, either because awareness of the stereotype causes stress that interferes with performance, or because such awareness causes individuals to give up in the face of negative perceptions.  The term was originated by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, who showed that black college students performed worse on standardized tests when they were reminded, before taking the tests, of their race. When their race was not primed, however, black students performed as well as white students. Our project was designed to test whether stereotypes and stereotype threat affect performance in the two different educational environments.   Intellectual Merit: The project has consisted of three major components.  First, we conducted an experimental study of Stereotype Threat using the standard protocol developed by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson.  Importantly, we failed to find any evidence of stereotype threat in a population at a historically black college. We have been as yet unable to complete our study at TAMU because of difficulty recruiting a sufficient number of black participants to achieve statistical validity. (The TAMU student body is about 3% black).  However, that data also showed no evidence of stereotype threat, and even hinted at a reverse effect: when reminded of their race, black students did better on the test than otherwise, but the difference was not statistically significant.   The second (and ongoing) component of the project consisted of a survey of students at TAMU and PVAMU that would be linked to their administrative performance data to assess the impact of stereotype threat vulnerability (using a survey measure) on student time to graduation, major, and grades.  The study also collects information on ability, past performance, and non-cognitive skills (behavioral factors such as grit, locus of control, personality, etc.) for use as controls.  We recruited subjects in two waves, Fall 2017 and Fall 2019.  At this point we are just waiting for enough students to graduate so that we can test our hypotheses with their administrative data records. The survey data alone hints at many differences between the two populations. Third, as part of the outreach mission of our project, we conducted a joint TAMU-PVAMU undergraduate research class with student and faculty participants from both schools.   Broader impacts:  The findings of the project have the potential to enhance the awareness of the possible impact of internalized discrimination (stereotype threat) on student performance, which has relevance for all academic fields, and for education research.  In addition, the project led to a long-term collaboration between researchers at the two different institutions.  This collaboration generates benefits to both schools.  Finally, the project provided training and research experience to undergraduate and graduate students at both institutions.
