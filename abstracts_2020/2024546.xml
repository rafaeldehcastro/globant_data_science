<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[With the fast advancement of space exploration, conducting materials research in space is becoming mainstream. At the same time, novel two-dimensional materials and polymer derived high temperature ceramics have captured the attention of the materials community. In this research project, two dimensional MXene will be incorporated into a silicon oxycarbide matrix to generate new materials, both on Earth and at the International Space Station. The high temperature evolution behaviors of two-dimensional materials and polymer to ceramic conversion under microgravity conditions will be systematically compared with the processes on Earth. These materials are expected to have high oxidation resistance, excellent electrical conductivity, and low density. They should also have great synergistic potentials for toughness, strength, and high temperature stability. The composites can be made into almost any shape (bulk, coating, discrete feature, et cetera) and size (nano- to macro-) based on application needs. In addition, these materials can easily produce complex shape, thin-wall, or freeform components with lightweight and functional capabilities in high temperature environments. This research will usher in a new generation of advanced materials which have great potential to be used  as heat exchangers, electric systems, catalyst support, energy storage, electrodes, nano-devices, and microsystems. Ultimately, project results will lead to new applications benefiting space science and life on Earth.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research project. The PI will expand current activities to Eastern Virginia while continuing efforts with different summer camps on campus. In addition, the PI will expand outreach efforts to the Western Virginia Science Museum to stimulate the interest of females and minorities in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will advance understanding of atomic- and nano-level species interactions under different gravitational conditions in order to explore a new class of high temperature stable and electrically conductive materials. The high temperature composites will include both dense and porous microstructures but the methodology developed will be applicable to a wide range of high temperature materials derived from 2D additives and polymer precursors. This research project is expected to develop new theories, provide new knowledge, and offer novel methods in   atomic level design and thermodynamic prediction of polymer derived ceramics. Results from this project will open new opportunities for  using microgravity to understand and create novel high temperature materials. The team will conduct the research using four approaches. First, using MXene exfoliation and surface functionalization, pre-pyrolysis at 500-700Â°C will be conducted in order to provide controlled states for microgravity and Earth gravity studies. Second, different atmosphere pyrolysis will be conducted on Earth and under microgravity to understand the atmosphere and gas release effects on new phase formation. Third, theoretical thermodynamic calculation and experimental pyrolysis studies will be combined in order to explore the fundamental interfacial interaction and phase evolution processes. Finally, gravitational effects on 2D MXene deformation, stacking, and chemical interaction with silicon oxycarbide during pyrolysis will be comprehensively investigated; the phase and structural evolution of the porous systems will be correlated with pore stability and shrinkage/collapse under different gravity conditions. The educational component is training of multiple graduate and undergraduate students, with a focus on women and minorities. The PI will expand current activities to Eastern Virginia while continuing efforts with different summer camps on campus. In addition, the PI will expand outreach efforts to the Western Virginia Science Museum to stimulate the interest of females and minorities in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
