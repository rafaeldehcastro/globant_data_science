<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This RAPID project is poised to develop a fast and inexpensive test to detect active infections of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic. The high costs of available rapid testing strategies limit their use in population-based screening, particularly in the most vulnerable low-resource communities. In contrast, the test developed here will be relatively inexpensive because it requires neither external power nor additional sample preparation and analysis instrumentation. The test will be tuned to detect the entire range of viral loads observed in individuals with active infections. The project team aims to both design the prototype device and establish proof-of-principle within the first three months of the project. To do so, a diverse and multidisciplinary team including six graduate students, a post-doctoral fellow, a medical doctor, two undergraduate students, and two U.S.-based manufacturers will be mobilized. The project will provide a profound humanitarian and educational experience for the trainees as they work quickly but deliberately to demonstrate the feasibility of a COVID-19 test device urgently needed throughout the world.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the proposal is to create a manufacturable microfluidic device capable of instantaneous diagnosis of active COVID-19 infections from nasal mucus or phlegm. The microfluidic device will employ ultrathin silicon 'nanomembranes' to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in the biofluid sample. Samples without the SARS-CoV-2 virus or with viral particles smaller than SARS-CoV-2 will not register a positive result. Modifications to the investigators' prior flow cell device designs will be made to ensure the two flow paths can be driven by the surface tension of the applied sample alone. The investigators have contracted with two U.S.-based companies for high-throughput manufacturing of the device components. Proof-of-concept demonstration will be conducted with nanoparticle SARS-CoV-2 surrogates and non-SARS-CoV2 spike protein controls. &lt;br/&gt;Studies will be conducted to define the sensitivity and specificity of the device, minimizing false negatives. Device manufacturing will be done using high-throughput strategies that can be readily translated to high-volume commercial manufacturing. A successful platform will be tested with samples from COVID-19 patients at a New York State flu center run by the University of Rochester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project established proof-of-principle operation of novel detection strategy for infectious agents in biofluids based on their size and surface antigens. Our sensors use our laboratorys ultrathin, precisely patterned, porous silicon membranes in a novel <em>fouling-based sensor</em> that requires both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">antigen recognition</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intact viral size </span>to produce a positive result. We built a microfluidic prototype (the uSiM-DX) powered by the act of pipetting 40 uL of sample into the device. We showed that when used to filter a fluid sample that may contain pathogens, the membrane in the device clogs (i.e. fouls) only in the presence of virus or bacteria large enough to occlude pores once captured on the pore walls. Membrane clogging produced a <em>hydraulic switch</em> which re-routes fluid to a positive indicator port. This PCR-free sensor creates a pathogen-specific result in seconds, requires no external power to operate or read, and directly addressed two shortcomings that became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) the inability of PCR to distinguish between intact virus and sub-viral RNA for weeks after a patient is no longer infectious, and 2) the lost sensitivity of lateral flow rapid tests because of the emergence of viral variants. Our proof-of-principle studies demonstrated the specific detection of virus based on size and surface antigen over the range of viral loads seen in symptomatic COVID-19 patients (10<sup>4</sup> - 10<sup>9 </sup>copies/mL) with greater than 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity (n = 62). The project resulted in one publication (Klaczko et al., 2022, Analyst, 147: 213-222) and one patent application (USPA 17/176,135; NSF CBET 2028537). Fully matured, we believe our approach has intrinsic advantages over the lateral flow ?rapid antigen tests? currently used for home-based diagnostics including: 1) greater sensitivity, 2) a sensor design that is agnostic to the emergence of viral variants, 3) the only assay that specifically detects <em>active</em> infection.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/17/2022<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;L&nbsp;Mcgrath</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2028537/2028537_10669421_1658081120246_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2028537/2028537_10669421_1658081120246_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3.
