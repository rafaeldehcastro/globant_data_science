<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The goal of this EAGER project is to examine the impacts of the UCLA Center for Diverse Leadership in Science (CDLS) faculty and trainee development models on ocean science education. The CDLS faculty development model aims to grow faculty skills in inclusive mentoring, inclusive teaching, and cultural awareness, and put these skills into practice. The trainee development model includes constructing learning environments to promote experiential learning, science identity, and social belonging, through team-based research, team-based outreach, and technical and higher skills development, with vertical and peer mentorship. For both faculty and trainees, CDLS builds communities of learning and practice. This project would do exploratory work to adapt and assess a new set of logic models for broadening participation in ocean sciences. It would create new curricular materials and implement them to transition a traditional theoretical undergraduate curriculum in a non-diverse department (Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences) into one that includes extracurricular field opportunities, problems-based activities, community outreach, and service learning. It will also impact teaching in two additional departments (Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, Environmental Science) where participants and collaborators teach. A broader aim will be to reach 200+ students/year once created, of which 25% will be from underrepresented groups. The project would support multiple trainees including undergraduates and graduate students from underrepresented groups, and an early career project scientist, as well as support partnerships with multiple high schools and youth centers in low-income minority neighborhoods, and a non-profit. Through assessment, conference presentations, and an initial manuscript on the results, the PIs will document learning gains, engagement, higher skills, persistence, and broadening participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test the impact of the CDLS logic models in ocean science education, and specifically will assess the impacts of the team's approaches on growth of 1) inclusive mentoring and teaching practices, and actions that relate to enhanced cultural awareness in faculty, and 2) engagement, grades, retention, science identity, and social belonging in trainees through stated activities. This approach should increase opportunities for undergraduate students to have hands-on and meaningful learning experiences in oceanography, that also promotes inclusion and the recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented groups in the field, while at the same time supporting the persistence of graduate students and early career scientists from underrepresented groups in the field. To achieve project goals, PIs will 1) grow cultural awareness skills and practices in current and future ocean science educators, through completion of mentoring curriculum by project participants, 2) undergraduate students working in teams with project participants from underrepresented groups by 3) curriculum modification, 4) field-based experiences, 5) service-learning projects with a local non-profit, and 6) student-created public ocean science engagement projects. PIs predict the focus on using oceanographic knowledge in service to address current problems, community outreach, and experiential learning, along with the provision of team-based work and concordant role models, will support high levels of recruitment, persistence, and engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

ECFs include post-baccalaureate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, of whom 80% are underrepresented minorities (URM), 87% people of color (POC), and 67% women, and are mentored by faculty fellows. We have further mentored 30 undergraduate students in laboratory- and field-based research. Curricula for six courses have been revised by CDLS Oceans faculty and staff. Approximately 100 students from these courses have toured research laboratory facilities with CDLS ECFs, engaged in field-based oceanography, and 500 students have taken classes with revised curriculum. Two staff members, project scientist and co-PI Jeana Drake, and CSUN graduate student Taylorann Smith, coordinate CDLS Oceans activities. To support these teaching and mentoring activities, two CDLS Ocean faculty members (PI Eagle and co-PI Tripati) and two research staff members have been trained to facilitate Entering Mentoring workshops, having participated in formal training designed by the University of Wisconsin-Madison&rsquo;s Center for Improved Mentoring Experiences in Research, and have offered two mentoring workshops to date.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Several team-based projects have been undertaken by CDLS Oceans to support priorities identified by partners, graduate student training, and workforce development.

To support cultural relearning, a CDLS Oceans ECF also worked with AMLT Youth to develop cultural and conservation curricula to be shared with the tribal community. In addition to our work with AMLT, we have been collaborating with Gabrielino-Tongva tribal members at the Kuruvunga Springs Foundation to sample water quality of one of their sacred spring sites and engaged in relationship building with Northern Chumash tribal representatives to learn more about their leadership in establishing a cultural marine protected area (MPA) in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A field-based project that has provided hands-on opportunities for multiple UCLA undergraduate students is run by two female graduate students, one of whom is a person of color.

To date, they have produced a dataset of 10 consecutive months&rsquo; worth of sampling. These data and comparable data from the restoration site sampling described above have been assembled and plotted in ArcGIS by a student admitted to UCLA&rsquo;s Grand Challenge program to compare (1) between onshore and offshore sites, (2) through time, and (3) to storm events.
