<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will organize workshops aimed at generating the next National Broadband Research Agenda (NBRA) report, an update to the NBRA 2016 report. The three main thrusts will be: i) broadband technology and deployment, ii) broadband economics, and iii) socioeconomic issues.  Progress since the last NBRA report (published in 2016) will be elucidated, and new and open research challenges will be identified. Workshop participants will be drawn from government, industry and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The internet has become a critical communications infrastructure, and access is among the ?assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, [that] are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof.? [CISA] But the internet is more than an issue for the nation as a whole. Internet access affects the security, health, safety, and opportunities in life for individuals and communities, and the economic vitality of businesses everywhere.   On the one hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the success of broadband access in allowing society to function, even during lockdowns. On the other hand, the pandemic has exposed weak, unreliable, or even nonexistent, broadband access and usability in many areas and for many individuals, including especially rural residents and children in many school districts, urban, and rural, as well as a compelling need for universal reach and affordability. It was thus timely that in November 2020, the National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored a series of workshops to identify new research areas to drive the broadband NSF agenda for the next five years. This request followed similar initiatives during the past twenty years, the most recent in 2016.           This Broadband Research Workshop Report of 2021 discusses the research questions and challenges that need to be addressed to provide robust, affordable, and meaningful broadband access to every resident of the United States.   The workshops took place, as video conferences, between November 4 and November 18, 2020. They were loosely structured around the themes of technology, economics and digital inclusion. The meetings centered on a series of questions for the participants, briefly summarized as the which, what and how of broadband: which technologies, economic tools, and social support require more research to facilitate broadband access in the next five years, what is the research that will clarify the economic and societal factors influencing this deployment and adoption, and how to deploy new broadband networks and ensure access by everyone who needs it.   The online workshops focused on technology, economics, and digital inclusion. Each was spread over two days to accommodate the different time zones of the participants. Participants represented academia, nonprofit research organizations, and NGOs along with some industrial and operator researchers. They were faculty, senior researchers, and advocates or even activists, many with international reputations and distinguished research credentials.
