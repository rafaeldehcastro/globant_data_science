<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The goal of their project is to determine the ecological and environmental contexts which lead to the evolution and persistence of mutualisms. Mutualisms, interactions in which each species benefits (e.g., pollination), are quite prevalent throughout the natural world especially among plant species and play a significant role in many ecological systems. One key mutualism is that between mycorrhizal fungi and plants. In this mutualism, individual plants trade sugars and other carbon compounds for nitrogen, phosphorous, and other minerals from the fungus. The availability of resources (environment) and competition from other individuals (ecology) should influence whether or not a plant is better off trading their resources and engaging in the mutualism. The fellow will experimentally and mathematically explore how environmental and ecological conditions determine the evolution of the plant-fungal mutualism. This work will not only explain the evolution of mutualism but also give greater predictive power as to how ecosystems will change with increased nitrogen deposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow will run a greenhouse experiment in which two varieties of peas, one that can and one that cannot form mutualisms, are grown with each other along gradients of nitrogen concentration and competitor density. In conjunction, they will develop and analyze an evolutionary game theoretic model of plant-fungal mutualism. Evolutionary game theory can aid in explaining this mutualism’s evolution as it frames the trade between plant and fungus as a strategy to obtain resources and the evolution as the exclusion of non-mutualist strategies. This work will empirically test the predictions of evolutionary game theory, thereby integrating theory and experiment. The fellow will learn techniques to run a greenhouse experiment, develop their statistical repertoire, and hone their mathematical skills. Beyond scientific work, the fellow will also work to increase participation of groups underrepresented in ecology, particularly those with disabilities. Firstly, they will directly mentor graduate and undergraduate students with disabilities by including them in the research. Secondly, they will develop digital and interactive media on game theory and ecological processes. Lastly, they will host graduate workshops on evolutionary game theory and mathematical modelling and undergraduate activities where students dissect a topic in ecology and evolution, analyze it mathematically, and create a game from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>Mutualisms play a vital role in both human and natural systems. For example, they form the backbone of coral reefs in marine systems and provide key services in the form of seed dispersal and pollination in plant systems. One key mutualism in particular is the plant-microbe mutualism. In this mutualistic relationship, the plants and microbes trade away resources, specifically carbon resources from the plant and nitrogen and phosphorous resources from bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi respectively, to each other. This mutualism is present in over 80% of plant species and was hypothesized to be responsible for the colonization of plants onto land. Nevertheless, our understanding of the mechanisms and conditions which led to the evolution and persistence of this mutualism remains incomplete. One way to explore this evolution is through the lens of evolutionary game theory (EGT). EGT is a mathematical framework that views the evolution of species as a series of reciprocal interactions that determine the eventual fitness of an organism and its trait evolution. In this project, I sought to examine how mechanisms and the ecological and environmental conditions, specifically plant competition, nitrogen availability, and sanctioning, influence the evolution of the plant-microbial mutualisms. I created three EGT mathematical models of eco-evolutionary dynamics and analyzed the resulting evolution and ecological community structure.</span></p> <p><span>To start off, I explored how plant-plant competition would affect the evolution of mutualism. Between-partner interactions &ndash; between plant and microbe &ndash; have been the major focus of mutualism evolution. However, within-partner interactions &ndash; between plants &ndash; can be significantly important in mutualism evolution. I showed that increasing local competition between plants would make mutualism fixation in a population less likely. This is because fewer of the microbial nutrients are shared between plants. Instead, mutualism would coexist with non-mutualist strategies with increasing competition. This coexistence only occurs when the nutrient resources are locally depletable, such as in the case of the mycorrhizal fungi which get their nutrients from organic sources. When resources are not locally depletable, like in the case of nitrogen-fixing bacteria like rhizobia, then competitor density has no effect. These results suggest a difference in how mutualisms may have evolved and persisted. Building upon that, I and an undergraduate student also explored how plant competition would effect mutualism evolution when sanctioning is added. We showed that high plant density hindered a plant&rsquo;s ability to sanction and differentially reward microbes since shading meant fewer carbon resources with which to reward beneficial microbes. Without effective partners, plants themselves would not invest in mutualism, leading to a breakdown of mutualism. Because plants with higher mortality had less density and competition, that often lead more mutualism in the system. Differences in mortality due to regional effects, life-history, and other matters may determine the level of mutualism found across the variety of plant species. Our results also point to the prominent role that carbon availability has in shaping the evolution of mutualism. These models were subsequently broadened to explore how coevolution between multiple species of plants and microbes would lead to mutualistic network structure using two different models of coevolution. Comparing models, we show that elements like drift and interactions like the parasitism-mutualism gradient can lead to variation in mutualism. Key to generating this variation and structure is control over access to the partnership. Without it, variation would not be maintained and species variation on both ends would collapse.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the scientific impact, this project has further improved the character of science. Firstly, it has supported the career development of a junior academic researcher who has now transitioned to being an assistant professor at an R1 research university. This project also allowed for the mentorship of two undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, one with a BIPOC background and one with mental health issues.
