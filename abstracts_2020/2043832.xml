<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[__________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Abstract - Sandeep Mertia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an ethnographic study of cultures of computing in start-up incubators, focusing on digital infrastructure, entrepreneurial practices, and state policies. The goal of this project is to critically examine the historical, socio-technical, infrastructural, governmental, and aspirational dimensions computing in start-up incubators, to advance comparative social scientific understandings of the global assemblages of technology start-ups and the promissory futures of digital innovation. In carrying out this research in the context of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, this project also opens a new vantage point for looking at disruptive socio-technical changes, particularly in postcolonial contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project ethnographically addresses three research questions. 1) How do digital infrastructures such as government application programming interfaces (APIs), platforms, and mobile apps shape—and how are they shaped by—the dual pursuit of governance and entrepreneurial value? 2) How do techno-entrepreneurs from different social backgrounds navigate the everyday practices of start-up incubation? How are they reimagining their agential capacities for innovation and social mobility amidst the on-going structural shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic? 3) How do computing in start-up incubators program seek to tether the recent global history of digital innovation and disruption to national futures? Based on multi-sited fieldwork, this project comparatively follows start-up incubators in a metropolitan and a tier-two city to spatialize the growing interface between the state and start-ups. The researcher deploys historical, virtual, and in-person ethnographic methods, including participant observation, semi-structured interviews, digital archival and software studies approaches, to track the former futures and the everyday imaginaries and practices of state-sponsored start-up incubation. This project combines interdisciplinary scholarship in STS, media studies, anthropology and related fields, to think through the three-way relations between the postcolonial state and technological nationalism, digital innovation and capitalism, and aspirational futures and social mobility. By focusing on the emergent relations between digital infrastructure and innovation in a computing start-up incubators ecosystem, this project contributes to global STS research on cultures of computing. By comparatively studying the techno-entrepreneurial journeys of aspirational youth in two cities, this project seeks to illuminate the hopes and discontents associated with an ever-accelerating digital economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   New York University PhD Candidate, Sandeep Mertia, advised by Prof. Arjun Appadurai, has completed the research for his dissertation, "Starting-up with the State: Computing, Entrepreneurship, and the Governance of Aspiration in India," supported by the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant #2043832. Based on 18-months of ethnographic and archival research in India, this project critically examines the historical and emergent dynamics of start-up incubation and the pursuit of promissory futures of digital innovation. Following the disruptive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented growth of technology start-ups in 2020-21, this project investigates the diverse and uneven spatialization of virtual work and digital acceleration in a postcolonial and global South context.  Based on long-term virtual and in-person participant observations at government and private start-up incubators in three cities, and seventy-five semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs, software engineers, venture capital investors, government bureaucrats, and consultants, this project offers a thick description of the cultural and technological constitution of India’s ‘start-up ecosystem’. It describes how a new generation of aspiring entrepreneurs, incubated or supported by the state, is navigating&mdash;and in many cases, failing&mdash;in an ever-expanding digital economy, particularly in tier-2 or small cities. By foregrounding how techno-entrepreneurs have adapted to and capitalized on "work from home," this project offers a timely analysis of the on-going normalization of the pace and place of digital acceleration in everyday life in different urban contexts. At the same time, through archival and media research, this project uncovers the intersecting histories of computing, start-up incubators, and the role of the state in governing national technological futures in the last three decades. By historically and ethnographically tracing the intertwinings of digital infrastructures, state policies for start-up incubation, and the aspirational subjectivities of entrepreneurs, this project offers a grounded analysis of socio-technical imaginaries of the future. Beyond the immediate academic contributions, this project also draws attention to policy issues surrounding the design and governance of public digital infrastructures (e.g., government APIs) to promote innovation, particularly in the global South. By situating emerging forms of techno-entrepreneurial subjectivities viz. structural hierarchies of gender, caste, religion, race, and class this research contributes to critical academic and public policy understandings of social inequality in the digital economy. To be completed in 2023, the dissertation contributes to a growing body of work in STS, media studies, anthropology, urban studies, and related fields that seeks to expand and decolonize the current geography of humanistic and social scientific understandings of computing and digital futures.
