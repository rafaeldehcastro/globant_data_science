<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative:  National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center).  The focus of a spectrum research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum.  This project, led by Dr. Kumar at Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station, includes a diverse set of research topics and collaborative opportunities and a clearly articulated set of milestones for planning activities leading to the establishment of a national center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes six key study topics as part of planning activities for the eventual establishment of a National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research: (i) platform, (ii) policies and technologies for dynamic spectrum access, (iii) coexistence of passive and active spectrum users, (iv) enhancing broadband wireless access for humans and machines, (v) cross-stack hardware and software reconfigurability, and (vi) data-driven radio circuits and services. By bringing together diverse communities related to spectrum usage, the PIs plan to identify the key challenges, and outline a road map for technology innovations along with policy prescriptions, that would lead to transformative ideas for spectrum usage/sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to explore the theory and practice of spectrum in terms of how well we understand its fundamentals and how good we have become in using it, with regard to future-proof spectrum management.   Our goal was to identify topics relating to platforms and policies for spectrum sharing across active and passive applications, and to explore these areas using seminars, virtual visits and courses, both from the viewpoint of learning from experts and to disseminate ideas to a broad audience     Multiple focused workshops were conducted, exploring the themes of coexistence of passive and active spectrum applications from both the technological and policy viewpoints.  Multiple workshops were also conducted on programming the spectrum using approaches drawn from AI/ML and its impact on enabling utilization of the Terahertz bands that have been under explored.  Many of the talks and seminars were recorded and disseminated widely.  The team identified major areas where research into spectrum is required and developed a competitive proposal for a spectrum innovation institute.      The project also informed and educated both students and the broader society on spectrum issues, with integration of ideas discovered from the project into the curricula at the participating institutions Several female and minority students were involved in all aspects of the project, including exploratory studies and graduate thesis work. Thus, the project also played a role in the integration of under-represented groups to the scientific community.
