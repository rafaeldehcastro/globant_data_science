<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a large-scale membrane system that will be constructed to separate salts from produced water in a more energy efficient manner. Produced water is water trapped in underground formations that is brought to the surface along with oil or gas. The membrane system is expected to purify produced water for commercial applications such as fracking or agriculture depending on the needs of the community. The outcomes of the project will translate technical knowledge to enhance the sustainability of produced water in many municipalities and industries in an energy-efficient way. Using the proposed technology, produced water treatment solutions may be provided to the 900,000 oil and gas wells in the United States. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a ceramic membrane filtration system to clean produced water. Disposal of salty and oily produced water in injection wells is not a sustainable solution because it is costly and induces seismic activity. There is a critical need for new methods to treat produced water in a cost-effective way. Addressing this need will require a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach and the ceramic membranes may offer a chemically-robust treatment option by reducing replacement and cleaning costs. The novelty of the project is in using hydrophilic ceramic membranes to reduce the impurity concentrations in produced water. The innovation of the proposed technology lies in the membrane fabrication technique. The necessary setups will be installed at the site for the treatment of produced water. The program is expected to define the requirements needed to produce an energy-saving scaled-up membrane system for cleaning produced water to levels suitable for reuse. A successful demonstration of the program has the potential to increase water supplies and reduce operational costs, energy consumption, and environmental impacts of produced water management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The I-Corps? program has been dedicated to developing cost-effective methods for treating produced water (PW). The outcomes of this I-Corps project are 1) the identification of key potential partners who can support the development and commercialization of the PW treatment system through design, customer discovery, user feedback, and market research. 2) The commercial viability of our membrane technology was explored through approximately 120 customer discovery interviews with employees of petroleum companies as well as regulatory organizations such as the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, Ground Water Protection Council, and Environmental Protection Agency. The customer discovery interviews indicated that salty and oily PW is often disposed of through injection wells without adequate treatment, creating a pressing need for innovative, cost-effective methods of purifying PW to minimize environmental stress and reduce disposal costs. Purifying PW in an economical manner will result in cleaner water that can be used for various purposes. 3) We successfully developed, demonstrated, and tested microfiltration alumina tubular membranes for PW treatment and built a crossflow system for continuous testing. The surface of the membrane was smoothed to enhance its antifouling properties and efficiency. The membrane system was tested using synthetic PW and found to effectively decrease carbon and solids levels. The intellectual merit of this effort was demonstrated by the creation of an energy-saving membrane system for treating PW, which has the potential to increase water supplies, lower operational costs, decrease energy consumption, and reduce the environmental impact of PW management. On the broader impacts, the study promoted a sustainable future by providing innovative solutions for PW treatment and building a positive relationship with the PW community.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/09/2023<br>      Modified by: Seokjhin&nbsp;Kim</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
