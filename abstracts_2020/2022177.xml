<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by supporting planning activities with clear potential to develop novel, leading edge research ideas and approaches to address NNA goals. It integrates aspects of the natural environment, built environment, and social systems to address important societal challenges at this intersection, builds significant educational opportunities, and engages with local communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even when it exists, formal water infrastructure in rural Alaska often fails to provide an adequate level of service to Alaskan households and communities. Operating water infrastructure in the Arctic is particularly difficult due to the unique coupling between the engineered systems and the unusually extreme challenges from social and natural systems. The small and remote nature of communities present unusual logistical, financial, and workforce challenges, while an extreme and changing climate further complicates the technical work needed to operate and maintain the systems. Accordingly, this project integrates knowledge of the water service challenges, data needs, and workforce issues experienced by Arctic communities and develop approaches to address these challenges and needs with appropriate strategies. Results from the needs assessment are used in teaching modules, and the knowledge generated is being used to develop an educational phone and tablet app that can be used as a tool available for utilities in public outreach. Broadly, this project is reducing uncertainty surrounding the operations of Arctic water infrastructure under conditions of climate change, and in doing so identifies new places where research is urgently needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enabled by semi-structured interviews and focus groups, this planning grant is designed to forefront Alaskan community member and utility operator knowledge. The team is visiting three communities in the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta to gather knowledge from individuals with diverse expertise, including treatment plant operators and the general public. Data are being transcribed and analyzed using emergent qualitative analysis to objectively explore questions discovered through a local needs assessment. Further, through team development using the Delphi method and concept modeling exercises, this grant is creating the research community needed to identify and address systemic problems facing Arctic water infrastructure and the people who use them. Knowledge is being returned to participating communities through professional organizations, anchor institutions, and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Accordingly, this project sought knowledge of the water service challenges, data needs, mitigation strategies, and workforce issues experienced by Arctic communities. This research was a partnership between Alaskan communities and organizations, and universities from across the United States. It was a transdisciplinary effort involving engineers, anthropologists, climate scientists, artists, tribal education specialists, and community infrastructure users and operators.

However, in Alaska many communities remain unserved. Seeking drivers behind this trend, we identified the spatiotemporal variations and the sociodemographic parameters that are correlated with the rates of in-home plumbing in Alaska communities. We found that complete plumbing is correlated to multiple characteristics, including the percentage of households that receive social security and are valued under $150,000. The many rural Alaskan regions revealed to have homes without access indicates a pressing need to invest in not only new water systems but also maintenance, operations, and capital improvements.</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To better explore drivers behind unserved communities, we then built a holistic, empirical systems model of the nature of water sector challenges in Alaska. This systems model targeted knowledge of the overall system operations. We identified challenges within the financial, human, natural, and technical systems involved in the provision of water services in rural Alaska. The systems approach allowed us to map interdependencies between these systems. We assessed cascading impacts caused by the arctic environment and by climate change that increase the number of unserved communities and system failures. Unsurprisingly, climate change exacerbates the challenging Arctic operating context, straining the financial and technical systems within water infrastructure.&nbsp; Communities are only able to pay for repairs using emergency funds that become available after system failures. Accordingly, service disruptions are linked to a lack of operations and maintenance funding.&nbsp; Further, we found that certification of operators posed a barrier to receiving infrastructure funding. To support certification of operators, this planning grant created a mathematics education app, which is described next.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2e2e2e; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Operator mathematics education was identified as a barrier to certification by many respondents interviewed in this research.

H2O Academy teaches the math concepts operators need to understand flow, concentrations, and equivalencies. Next, the app takes the user through a water treatment plant schematic. In each part of the water treatment plant, the app helps users develop comfort solving math questions typical to and contextualized by that stage of water treatment.
