<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The coronavirus pandemic has affected children and families worldwide. In the US, schools and closed, yet there is variability across states and cities regarding pandemic recommendation on social distancing.  The situation likely affects different children in different ways, due to varying levels of familial financial impact, self or family COVID-19 illness, mental health effects of social distancing and stress, online activity, scholastic activity, adult supervision, and indirect health influences of altered physical activity, sleep, and access to nutrition.  The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development project (ABCD) is a longitudinal study of 11,878 diverse youth enrolled at ages 9-10 in 2016-2018 (birth years 2006-2009) at 21 research sites around the United States.  This RAPID project will design and implement a new survey, to assess personal impact of COVID-19 on ABCD participants and families. With this new information, we can leverage existing ABCD data to examine perturbations in developmental trajectories of brain functioning, neurocognition, mental health, substance use, academic achievement, and social functioning. By immediately collecting a unique set of measures that characterize the pandemic’s effects, we can make use of the existing ABCD protocol and design in this large, diverse, national sample.  Results from this study will provide substantially improved guidelines for future epidemics and pandemics, and indicate potential targets for interventions when other traumas affect children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ABCD cohort is being followed until at least age 20, with: biennial state-of-the-art neuroimaging, epigenetics/genetics, and physical activity tracking; annual cognitive testing and assessments with youth and parents on mental and physical health and development, life events and trauma exposure, culture and environment, substance use, sleep, and screen time; and biannual brief assessments of mental health and substance use.  The proposed research would immediately characterize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on each child via a youth and parent self-assessment that characterizes their personal level of family disruption, social distancing and its impact, attitudes, adherence to public health directives, and media exposure. This crisis provides a unique opportunity to make use of ABCD’s elaborate infrastructure and rigorous scientific processes to discern critical dimensions of behavior not previously envisioned. The impending severity of this unanticipated pandemic may result in significant influences on school-age youth for decades, and this RAPID will be critical to characterizing factors that protect and exacerbate its effects. This research will immediately examine COVID-19 related effects on youth, and how their practices around virus transmission and prevention vary as a function of family and social factors, external influences, and other characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

We sent 7 surveys, every 2 months from May 2020 to May 2021 to ABCD participants and their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately half the cohort completed each survey, and across the 7 surveys, over 9500 youth (ages 11-14) in the ABCD cohort (N=11,878) completed one or more survey.&nbsp;</p> <p>This COVID-19 related research provided opportunities for multiple postdoctoral fellows working at in ABCD, including Drs.

To date, 6 papers have been submitted for publication to peer-reviewed journals, and findings from this work have been presented at over 8 national conferences in the past year.</p> <p><strong>Significant results:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Youth substance use during the pandemic</strong> (led by Dr. Will Pelham). Participants reported whether they had used alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, or other substances in the past 30 days. Data were linked to pre-pandemic surveys that the same youth had completed in the years 2018-2020, before the pandemic. Past-30-day substance use remained stable in the 6 months since stay-at-home orders were first issued in U.S. states/counties, Compared to before the pandemic, fewer youth were using alcohol and more youth were using nicotine or misusing prescription drugs. During the pandemic, youth were more likely to use substances when they were more stressed by pandemic-related uncertainty, the family experienced material hardship, parents used substances, or they experienced depression or anxiety. Engagement in social distancing and worrying about COVID-19 were NOT associated with youth substance use.</li> <li><strong>Family and economic hardship</strong> (led by Dr. Marybel Gonzalez). Pandemic-related financial insecurity, loss of social support, and difficulty caring for a child were also associated with poorer family well-being. Families with single caregivers showed resilience in family well-being despite more financial insecurity. Parent alcohol use was a risk factor for poorer family well-being, especially among vulnerable families experiencing pandemic-related material hardship. Positive coping strategies (e.g., exercise and relaxation) supported better family well-being. Findings emphasize the importance of financial assistance and mental health and social support for families to promote healthy family well-being and resilience during and after an enduring stressor, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Risk and buffering factors</strong> (led by Dr. Orsolya Kiss). We examined the 20 most important predictors of depressive symptoms (out of 221 variables) using machine learning in young adolescents in the ABCD study during the pandemic. Girls and those with more pre-existing internalizing problems were more vulnerable to depressive symptoms. On the other hand, better quality relationships with family and friends and longer sleep duration was associated with lower depressive symptoms. Having witnessed racism or discrimination in relation to the coronavirus was linked to a greater increase in depressive symptoms.</li> <li><strong>Mood</strong> (led by Dr. Connor McCabe). We found that females and youth with pre-COVID psychopathology may be struggling most during the pandemic, particularly in the early months when quarantine was wide-spread. We also found that establishing and maintaining routines may help promote resilience among youth during stressful times. Many children are managing stressors effectively across the first three months of the pandemic. Most report moderate hopefulness and COVID-related worries, and few are reporting clinically-relevant levels of negative emotions. Children are reporting better emotional functioning across the first three months of the pandemic study window (May through July/August). Self-reported mental health increased, while stress, sadness, and COVID worry decreased.</li> <li><strong>Screen time</strong> (evaluated by Drs. Florence Breslin and Susan Tapert).&nbsp; We found that screen time increased during pandemic, especially interactive screen activities such as social media use and multi-playing gaming. More pandemic-era interactive screen time was linked to more communication with friends, but worse subjective well-being. Before and during the pandemic, more interactive and non-interactive screen use was linked to more feelings of loneliness.</li> <li><strong>Geocoded data on local pandemic severity</strong> (led by Dr. Andrew Marshall). Family- and neighborhood-level disadvantage were associated with parent-reports of greater family burden, less perceived exposure risk, and more frequent parent-child conversations about COVID-19 risk/prevention and reassurance, and greater child preventative behaviors. Despite increased disease burden, more disadvantaged families may be adaptively incorporating more protective strategies to reduce emotional distress and likelihood of child COVID-19 infection.</li> </ul><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/12/2021<br>      Modified by: Susan&nbsp;Tapert</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
