<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Undergraduate research experiences focused on regional issues are an effective way to increase retention of underrepresented students in STEM fields nationally. Alaska offers a rich diversity of field- and lab-based research experiences, with much of this work being led by institutions outside of the academic setting. However, it has proven to be challenging to connect university students interested in pursuing careers in STEM fields in Alaska with those opportunities. The main goal of the Alaska Undergraduate Research Experience is to connect Alaskan students to local research opportunities in biological sciences to increase retention and better prepare students to enter research endemic to Alaska. This project will bring the Alaskan research community together to develop community partnerships with local research projects (e.g. local tribal councils, non-profits, state and federal agencies across Alaska) and create pathways for future undergraduate research opportunities. To sustain the network in its infancy, collaborators will participate in training workshops that strengthen skills in building and sustaining community, mentoring, and cross-cultural relationships. A website will be developed to connect undergraduates to research opportunities and to provide an information hub to tie communities in remote locations to research that is accessible to their students. Alaskaâ€™s diversity, both in research, in its people, provide a unique opportunity to connect people in national biological research industries to the regional communities that they are exploring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will identify community partnerships with local research projects, provide workshops on Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE) development and place-based education for collaborators, develop a network informational hub within the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) website, and evaluate the network. The University of Alaska - Anchorage and Alaska Pacific University serve non-traditional student populations and enroll a diverse student body, including a large percentage of Alaska Native students. Students from these institutions will be connected to the network collaborators to engage in directed biological research for course credit. To ensure that the network is sustainable, the SERC website will serve as a permanent platform to connect local research projects with interested students. The outcomes of this initial network-building project will guide future expansions of the regional network and will inform retention efforts of underrepresented undergraduates in the biological sciences nationally. This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in "Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action" (http://visionandchange/finalreport) with additional support provided by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   AK UNiTE is a new research network that connects Alaskan undergraduate students in biology to place-based research opportunities. AK UNiTE?s overarching goal is to improve the recruitment and retention of underserved Alaskans in the sciences by developing a network connecting faculty and students to research in the locations where they attend undergraduate classes. In collaboration with the Science Education Resource Center, a website (https://serc.carleton.edu/AK_Unite/index.html.) was created to facilitate recruitment and network activities. In 2020-21, AK UNiTE launched its pilot year which resulted in the recruitment of 15 community researchers reflecting a range of organizational affiliations including public and private universities (56%), federal, state, and tribal governments (21%), nonprofits (11%), and a tribal community college (5%). In summer 2021, AK UNiTE provided paid research opportunities for 19 undergraduate students (with 67% of students reporting a non-white race/ethnicity and 67% identifying as female) from the University of Alaska and Alaska Pacific University. Students were selected for summer internships based on having minimal research experience and demonstrated financial need. Selected students were matched with an AK UNiTE research partner based on overlapping interests. Summer research internships were short in duration (80-100 hours) with flexible scheduling to support participation from nontraditional students and underrepresented minorities in biology. For many of these students, the AK UNiTE summer internship was their first opportunity to conduct research outside of the classroom environment. 100% of students and 86% of researchers reported satisfaction with project activities.

AK UNiTE is a growing network and will continue to recruit additional community partners, with a greater focus on providing mentorship training  to research partners in its next phase.
