<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to demonstrate the feasibility of the virtual garment creation and try-on system. As businesses increase their e-commerce presence, they face a major challenge: the high rate of returns in e-commerce. The return rate for online purchases exceeds that of in-store purchases by roughly 4 to 1, with customers (52-74%) citing dissatisfaction with the garmentsâ€™ fit as the primary reason for returns. A reduction in returns as small as 1% could keep over 50 million pounds of goods out of the landfill and return $2.3 B to fashion retailers. This Phase I project is aimed at developing a sophisticated process using 3D modeling and fabric simulation technologies to enable customized fit and sizing visualizations prior to purchase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of the virtual garment creation system by using machine learning, numerical simulations and 3D graphic rendering to generate virtual garments based on (i) images and text that describe the garment and (ii) a minimum set of measurements of the customer's body.  This process will advance the translation of novel approaches to combining artificial intelligence and 3D representation of a deformable shape in a computationally efficient manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Yet, the pressure to offer easy returns for online purchases is great. Indeed, 11,000 apparel stores closed in 2020. While COVID-19 dealt a tremendous blow, closures were already a sustained trend<a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?T0eBnc">]</a>. The so-called "retail apocalypse" closed 7500 fashion stores in 2019, and 6100 in 2018. Hence, it is critical that fashion brands develop a stronger online presence to survive. In 2019, these returns cost US fashion brands more than $100B dollars, roughly one-third of their total revenue (including brick and mortar sales).<br /><br />To address the online returns fashion e-commerce pain-point, Couture Technologies' proposes an innovative virtual try-on tool [Figure 1] that delivers custom fit and sizing visualizations to retail customers. The Virtual Try-On tool consists of a sophisticated data pipeline using 3D modeling and fabric simulation technologies. Specifically, customers will be able to easily create a personal <em>virtual avatar</em> that reflects their own body measurements and can be used to try on clothes. Using inputs of (i) images and text describing a garment and (ii) a minimum set of measures describing a user's body, the proposed pipeline uses machine learning (ML) algorithms, numerical simulations, and 3D graphic rendering techniques to create a photorealistic image that accurately depicts how the garments a user selects online would look on their body. By allowing customers to accurately visualize how apparel items will look and fit prior to purchase, this technology will reduce the number of online returns, thus reducing brand's costs and improving their margins.<br /><br />&nbsp;Within this landscape, specifically for proposal #2026135, Couture aimed at attacking one major technical challenge that has caused virtual try-on to fail in gaining widespread adoption. This lies in the process to create the 3D virtual garment (i.e. the dataset needed to simulate the physical garment) which is required for the custom fit and sizing visualization. Existing commercial solutions obtain their virtual garments from a combination of CAD files, human technicians, and 3D scanners. However, these processes for virtual garment creation introduce additional economic and logistical challenges that brands might not be able or willing to tackle.
