<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Coulomb electrostatic interaction is one of the fundamental forces in nature, governing how elementary charged particles interact. For example, stars are essentially plasmas - that is gases of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons attracting and repelling one another according to the Coulomb force. The formation of crystals, which are periodic arrangements of atoms, can be roughly explained via repulsive electrostatic (Coulomb) forces coupled with a binding force. In Physics, a "two-component plasma" is a large collection of positively charged particles and as many negatively charged particles; a "one-component plasma" is a large collection of positively charged particles with the negative particles replaced by a uniform neutralizing background. Such systems are also called "Coulomb gases," and they are quite important in theoretical physics. Physicists predicted that in two-dimensional Coulomb gases, a new intermediate state of matter - formed of dipoles of oppositely charged particles - should exist between the totally ordered (solid) and disordered (liquid) state, once a certain critical temperature is reached. This was a new type of phase transition in statistical physics. It is specific to dimension 2 and an important example of two-dimensional physics. This project is particularly concerned with the analysis of large Coulomb gases in dimension 2 and higher, both one-component and two-component, in the framework of statistical mechanics (that is, with temperature), and using the techniques of mathematical analysis and probability theory. Also motivating such questions are the study of energy levels of large atoms (spectrum of large random matrices), vortices in superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates, the fractional quantum Hall effect, and more loosely questions in biology or hydrodynamics. The project also contains a component on the mathematical analysis of vortices in superconductors in the context of the famous Ginzburg-Landau model, another and related instance of two-dimensional physics, with the investigation of this phenomenon in dimension 3. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is about the mathematical analysis of large systems of points, or lines, with Coulomb  interactions. Such systems are ubiquitous in physics models, ranging from quantum  mechanics, statistical mechanics to plasma physics and condensed matter physics, but also in random matrix theory and approximation theory. The main part of the proposal concerns the statistical mechanics of classical Coulomb gases. In a first part it deals with positively charged points. The main questions are to investigate the  effect of temperature on the  local structure of the point configurations, in broad temperature regimes, as well as to understand their possibly universal features. While a lot has been understood in dimension 2, much remains to be done to understand which properties persist in higher dimension, in particular to understand the order of the charge fluctuations and their possibly Gaussian nature, as well as the long-range correlations of the system and free energy expansion. The proposal also aims at understanding  how much of the features are specific to the Coulomb interaction by investigating the same questions for  Riesz gases. A second part concerns the two-dimensional Coulomb gas with opposite charges (or two-component plasma). This is a very important model, related to the XY model in which a similar transition happens, itself an approximation for two-dimensional systems in condensed matter physics  including Josephson junction arrays and thin disordered superconducting granular films. This BKT transition is charcterized by the emergence of dipoles and the transition from exponentially decaying to algebraically decaying correlations. A lot of this behavior is awaiting further mathematical proofs and this is what the project will try to address in the context of the two-component Coulomb gas. Finally the last part of the proposal concerns lines with Coulomb interactions, which arise as vortices in three-dimensional models from superconductivity and superfluidity. The geometry of the lines makes the analysis much more delicate than for points. While many mathematical tools originating in geometric measure theory have been developed for dealing with that aspect, the Coulomb interaction of the lines, the characterization of the onset of vortex lines under an applied magnetic field, and their collective behavior still need to be further investigated. The project's goal is to study all these questions with rigorous mathematical proofs and tools that will mix analysis, PDE, calculus of variations, and probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project has concerned the investigation of both statistical equilibrium states and collective dynamics of Coulomb and Riesz gases, i.e. systems of many particles with singular interactions of Coulomb type.  A large part of the project has consisted in furthering our understanding and the tools at our disposal to prove mean-field limits for the dynamics : this means deriving rigorously the effective collective dynamics of a large system of N interacting points or particles evolving along energy steepest descent, possibly with added diffusion (i.e. noise in the form of Brownian motion).  The effective dynamics are Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that govern the evolution of the particle density. Such questions are ubiquitous and important for physics, biology and social science, and to obtain rates of convergence to equilibrium states in gradient descent methods, for instance for the optimization of the parameters of large neural networks.  The case of regular interaction is easier and for that reason the project has generally focused on the singular case and more precisely on  a class of singular interactions, which are repulsive and of Riesz type, i.e. inverse power of the distance with a power s less than the dimension d. This includes the physically important Coulomb case.    With various collaborators, in particular Matthew Rosenzweig, we have worked at improving the tools to prove this convergence,  in particular to obtain convergence rates which are uniform in time, as desirable and understand when this is possible. The second main direction has concerned large systems of particles in Coulomb or Riesz interaction, but at statistical equilibrium, in general dimension. The project has first focused on the case of particles of same charge with repulsive Coulomb or Riesz interaction, with the aim of understanding the precise distributions on the particles down to the microscopic level. The PI's student Eric Thoma has in particular put forward a new approach which has yielded a series of new results and proofs of conjectures.  Recently, the focus has turned towards proving rigorously the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition that happens for the ``two-component plasma", that is the situation with particles of opposite charges (N particles +1 and N particles -1) with Coulomb interaction in the plane, which can pair into dipoles and multipoles. Finally, vortices in the three dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity have been analyzed with Carlos Roman and Etienne Sandier, with a precise description of the critical magnetic field value at which they arise,  their interaction and the patterns that they form. The project has allowed for students and postdocs training opportunities, it has also allowed the writing of a lecture notes book on Coulomb gases based on several short and long courses given by the PI, and which should help young researchers get familiar with the topic and recent research development.
