<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[According to Data USA, there were 35,342 Computer Science degrees awarded in 2016 as compared to other STEM degrees awarded in 2016 such as 180,651 Engineering degrees and 150,020 Biology degrees.  Additionally, there is a disparity among the number of Computer Science degrees awarded to underrepresented groups. Females earned 21% of the Computer Science degrees, of which less than 1% were awarded to women of color. Utilizing National Science Foundation core values to accommodate contributions from all groups, this project funds Pillars of Inclusion (POI), an annual hands-on symposium with education and technology teachers as well as leaders in Computer Science for the next four years.  The vision of the POI symposium addresses the challenges to educate and prepare qualified Computer Science teachers that define and implement classroom practices that reflect diversity and inclusion necessary to broaden computer science education communities.  The POI Symposium presents a paradigm shift of thinking in the realm of the question, “What is equitable teaching for all?” Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) of the Association of American Colleges encourages STEM faculty to promote excellence in social responsibility and diversity to graduate all students in STEM.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The PKAL Capital Regional Network represents university members that embody various levels of exposure to teaching Computer Science from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) such as Bowie State University, Morgan State University, and University of the District of Columbia.  The goal of the POI Symposium is to provide a forum in which the PKAL Capital Regional Network can explain, instruct and demonstrate hands-on practices that explore equitable teaching practices of Computer Science to include implementation and practices of the following terms:  Diversity, Inclusion, Empathy, Exposure and Equity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
