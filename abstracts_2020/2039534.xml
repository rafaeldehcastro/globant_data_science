<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of new tools to prevent future mosquito disease outbreaks. Most US mosquito control organizations lack the capability or capacity to conduct routine mosquito surveillance, a necessary task for effective mosquito control. Globally, 80% of the world population is at risk for mosquito-borne disease, and mosquito surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation are widely recognized as critical public health activities o be scaled globally. The technology developed through this proposal will develop and demonstrate the feasibility of new identification methods to reduce operational mosquito surveillance costs, while improving accuracy and standardization of data. The result will be improved decisions that will reduce the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will build on advances in computer vision for high accuracy identification of mosquito species in operational contexts. While high accuracy classification of mosquito species has been demonstrated using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), evidence has been limited to controlled laboratory environments, with small datasets of few species, or with lab reared specimens. Operational environments face a significantly more complex problem, with hundreds of potential species that may be encountered, and variation in morphology and quality of wild-caught mosquitoes. This proposal seeks to overcome and mitigate the core technical challenges unaddressed by the current state of research, including: fine-grain classification techniques required to distinguish medically relevant species from over three thousand mosquito species found in nature with significant overlapping morphology, novel species detection methods to identify when a presented specimen is from species unknown to the species classification algorithms, and characterizing the feeding state and the physical quality of specimens, such as damage to wings, legs, scales, and body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

There are an estimated 2,000 mosquito control districts in the US, responsible for surveillance and control of mosquito populations.

Although deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks, are incredibly powerful and effective at learning data patterns in images, they are also extremely susceptible to data biases. The bulk of this work focused on addressing subtle variability and data biases that occur within and between IDX devices, despite manufacturing consistency. This effect could be observed by disjointing data gathering between the training data and test data; algorithm accuracy on test data gathered at the same time as training data may be 95% accurate, but algorithm accuracy on test data gathered at a separate time may only be 50% accurate. Our work on this issue focused on minor variability in color profile of the devices and variability in the background of the image. We initially address these issues using image processing based operations for image standardization, algorithm generalization, and masking of specimens. Addressing these challenges resulted in 80% accuracy on the test set. End to end testing of the algorithm deployed in the IDX device, operated by a beta customer showed accuracy for 5 target species with significant data in the training set of 97%.
