<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide new methods and materials to improve electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency (RF) shielding.  EMI/RF shielding are critical for protecting electronic devices from electromagnetic disruption, interference, or data theft.  The uninterrupted operation of these electronic devices is essential in a wide range of existing and emerging products and applications, from mobile technologies and personal computing to internet of things, smart textiles, and wearable electronics.  However, poor mechanical contact and issues with reliable sealing are critical pain points for EMI/RF shielding applications related to these applications.  Improved performance depends on materials that are highly deformable and can maintain a low "lack of conformity" between mating surfaces, an acute challenge that has driven commercial demand for softer and more deformable EMI/RF shielding materials. This project will advance the development of a new material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a materials technology that combines high performance electromagnetic interference (EMI) with extreme elasticity, mechanical compliance, and toughness.  This technology is based on a liquid metal embedded elastomer (LMEE) architecture in which droplets of liquid metal are suspended within a soft elastomer matrix. These composites have a unique combination of properties not possible with other elastomers: (i) high electrical conductivity, (ii) high strain limit, (iii) low elastic modulus, and (iv) high fracture toughness. Because of its high electrical conductivity, LMEEs are effective in disrupting electromagnetic waves and RF signals.  Furthermore, because of its high elasticity and tear resistance, LMEE can be used for EMI shielding within tubing, hoses, seals, gaskets, and rubber-based packaging as well as in bags, clothing, and other textiles.  This project will result in an LMEE composite with adequate conductivity to shield electronic devices from interference over a wide range of frequencies.  Moreover, it will be mechanically robust and resistance to the leakage of liquid metal when torn or punctured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The major goals of Phase I were to identify a pathway for commercializing liquid metal embedded elastomer (LMEE) composites and refine the formulation and fabrication to meet customer specifications. Based on customer feedback, we chose to focus on developing rubber-based thermal interface material (TIM), which we call TIMbber, due to the unique combination of elasticity and high thermal conductivity that LMEEs exhibit. Arieca has succeeded in accomplishing the following Phase I objectives: (i) identify LMEE formulation for use in TIM applications; (ii) develop a method for mass scale manufacturing of LMEE-based TIM using industrial shear mixing; (iii) characterize material properties and TIM-performance through in-house and 3rd party testing; (iv) engage with potential customers for product feedback, product qualification, and exploration of non-recurring engineering contracts. In summary, our Phase I effort involved extensive customer discovery, engagement in early-stage customer and product qualification, and further improvements to our material formulation in order to accelerate the use of LMEEs for applications in electronics packaging.  The Intellectual Merit of this project related to improvements of the LMEE formulation, with a special focus on improving mechanical and thermal properties. This has included efforts to explore a variety of polymer matrix materials to improve the adhesion of LMEEs to various materials used in packaged electronics. Such contributions will inform the development of LMEEs for other use cases besides TIM applications.  Moreover, it has led to a greater understanding of how liquid metal alloys interface with soft polymers and how the polymer can be tailored for improved adhesion with contacting surfaces.  The Broader Impact of this Phase I effort includes advancements in high performance computing and opportunities for workforce development.  The application of LMEEs to thermal management in packaged electronics enables computing hardware to run at higher clock speeds without overheating.  Specifically, the removal of heat is important for maintaining reliability since high temperatures lead to lifetime degradation of silicon die. Moreover, this project has provided funds to hire and support scientists, engineers, and commercialization experts working full-time at Arieca. Through their experiences working on this project, these members have gained skills in interdisciplinary research, product qualification, market discovery, and technical engagement with industrial partners.
