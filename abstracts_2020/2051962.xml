<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve diagnosis of eye conditions with a better tool for ocular fluid biopsies. Ocular fluid biopsies are important in diagnosis and treatment, but this procedure is under-utilized due to flaws with the current method for collecting fluid; furthermore, the fluid in the eye is isolated from the rest of the body, so blood work does not help in diagnosis. Because of this, most ocular infections are diagnosed and treated based on their clinical appearance without additional data from fluid testing. This research will advance a new tool to collect ocular fluid safely and effectively. This will aid in diagnosis of sight-threatening conditions including macular degeneration, glaucoma and ocular infections, enabling earlier diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) I Project will advance a new medical device for ocular fluid biopsies. Ocular fluid biopsies can be used for conditions beyond infections in the eye. The proposed instrument will be designed specifically for collection of fluid from the front of the eye. Tasks include: (1) optimization of the needle to decrease the force of entry to enhance the surgeonâ€™s control and decrease risk of injury; (2) investigation of the fluid dynamics of collection with the integration of a microfluidic chamber and specialized collection system designed to handle small fluid volumes because the current method leads to fluid loss and inaccurate results. Additional work will evaluate advanced engineering features to enhance safety for this procedure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
