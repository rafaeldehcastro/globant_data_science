<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will support the participation of junior researchers (students, postdocs, and early-career faculty members) in the Workshop on Artificial Intelligence (AI) Applications in Nuclear Physics that will be held on March 4-6, 2020, in Newport News, Virginia. The Workshop will help define the priorities of the U.S. nuclear physics community with respect to AI applications in nuclear physics. The goal of the Workshop is to document areas where AI can be used to meet the scientific goals outlined in the Nuclear Sciences Advisory Committeeâ€™s 2015 Long Range Plan. AI applications to Theory, Experiment, and Accelerator operations and design will be addressed. The findings of the Workshop will be collected in a workshop report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction    The Computational Physics Program of the National Science Foundation/Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences/Division of Physics provided grant funding to support the participation of up to 25 undergraduate students, graduate students, and early career professionals in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Nuclear Physics Workshop hosted by Jefferson Lab, a DOE National Laboratory, on March 4-6, 2020.   The workshop included plenary sessions, six working groups, and a networking reception.  The 184 workshop participants included researchers from government, academia, and industry.  A student hackathon competition was held on March 3 as a pre-workshop event.   Workshop findings are summarized in a Final Report (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05422.pdf).       Broader Impacts  The Broader Impacts efforts of the project consisted of proactive outreach announcing the availability of the NSF-funded travel grants to organizations of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in nuclear physics research based on ethnicity or gender, subject specialization, and academic levels.  In addition to announcements of the travel grants posted on the conference website and sent to traditional physics research groups and long-time collaborators, notices soliciting applications for the travel grants by students and early career professionals were sent to:  The National Society of Hispanic Physicists (publisher of NSHP News and The Hispanic Physicist)  Black Women in Computing (Listserv posting) Hispanics in Computing (Listserv posting) XSEDE News Participants of the 2017 Blacks in AI Conference Former AAAS S&amp;T Fellows (Listserv posting)   Project Outcomes  Twenty-five applications were submitted, including several from specialists in computational analysis, mechanical engineering, computing, computer science, and astrophysics which were outside of traditional physics community.  The travel grant selection committee determined that eighteen of the twenty-five applications were worthy of receiving a travel grant, which consisted of $1,500 plus the workshop registration fee.  Most of the travel grant recipients, including the undergraduate students, indicated they would not have been able to participate in the workshop without the funding provided by NSF.  Four undergraduate students and three women were among those selected to receive the travel grants.   Hackathon Competition  Workshop organizers secured supplemental funding from the University of Virginia School of Data Sciences and Amazon Web Services to host a hackathon competition prior to the workshop.  Eight teams of four participants competed on solving a common nuclear physics problem with progressively difficult challenge problems.  The teams? approaches differed significantly illustrating the ingenuity of the participants.  An automated scoring system was used and the top two teams received prizes.   Six of the NSF travel grant recipients participated in the competition, including three who were members of the first place team.  The spokesperson for the first place team was a sophomore who received travel grant funding.             Last Modified: 06/08/2021       Submitted by: Russell Moy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
