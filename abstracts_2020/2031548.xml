<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has recently reached pandemic status spreading all around the world. The severity of the pandemic, along with an enormous impact on world’s economy and society, has forced governments to introduce emergency measures. It is essential to utilize the available statistical data from trusted sources in order to model and evaluate the dynamics of the pandemic spread, to not only better understand such complex systems, but to learn and develop possible solutions to prevent further spread of current and/or similar future outbreaks. Thus, this research, devoted to the development of mathematical models of COVID-19 pandemic spread, addresses an urgent national need. Faculty and students in computer science, anthropology, and computational chemistry at New Mexico Highlands University have formed a diverse group for finding a solution to the complicated problems of the description and prediction of COVID-19 spread. This multidisciplinary project is expected to yield a better understanding of the interconnections among many factors that contribute to the spread of COVID-19. Statistical data will be collected in regions of Northern New Mexico, including San Juan and McKinley Counties in the Navajo Nation and Los Alamos county outside of the Navajo Nation. Analysis of the collected statistical data along with socio-cultural assessment from this project will be presented to New Mexico (NM) tribal and health authorities. The project will aim to provide a scientific basis for the prediction of disease spread and will consider scenarios associated with the possibility of another wave of the pandemic. Students from this minority-serving institution involved in the project will obtain valuable experience in the application of advanced machine learning models and methods in providing fast robust reaction to a national health, economic, and societal crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, machine learning methods will be used to analyze pandemic spread scenarios in different regions and to glean the most important features of the data characterizing the spread. The research team will use both traditional machine learning techniques and advanced methods, such as artificial neural networks, allowing development of virus incidence model capturing dependencies in both linear and nonlinear domains. The work will concentrate on understanding disease spread with regard to multiple socioeconomic factors. The problem can be treated as a sequence modeling one; so, recurrent neural networks and more complex models based on their recurrent cells might be one promising direction. The next step will be to assemble datasets for small isolated communities with different socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicities – comparing Navajo Indians living on the Navajo reservation to Los Alamos County (NM) – and to test the applicability of the developed model to these regions. The spatiotemporal data available on the spread is heterogeneous in character. An important goal of this research is to classify the collected data with respect to the similarity in the epidemic curve behavior and then build separate models for different regions according to this classification. The proposed model will be used for prediction of future incidents and to produce the most effective non-medical recommendations for suppression and prevention of future viral outbreaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is supported by the Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program and the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory (CMMT) program in the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Science using supplemental funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  NSF RAPID program supplies a significant boost to the COVID-19 non-clinical research, which is of the utmost importance today, to supply a solution to both slow the spread of the virus and ease the pandemic worldwide crisis.       The  primary goal of our research was to glean important characteristics of  viral spread for indigenous populations ?specifically the Navajo Nation.  Our group developed models to predict and classify viral spread within  this population. The question that we wanted to answer pertained to  mitigation of the spread of the virus through informed and decisive  health policies put in place. Our group used various  traditional machine learning methods and more sophisticated hybrid deep  learning methods coupled with epidemiological physics models to predict  and classify viral spread and classify types of demographic viral  spread. The coupled predictor models agreed nicely with the actual data  from our different populations of interest. The classifier models allowed our group to discern important similarities between populations globally. Of  particular interest was the similarity between our Navajo Nation  research population and Senegal. The most striking result in this study  was the importance of health policies that are enforced swiftly. The  ability to mitigate the spread of the virus hinged upon the ability to  develop informed health policies that could be easily implemented across  the population of interest. Because the Navajo Nation is a sovereign  nation, the president of the Navajo Nation was able to swiftly implement  health policies to mitigate the spread of the virus. As a side note,  the Navajo Nation had the highest number of infected individuals per  total population and an equally high mortality rate in the US at the  beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19. The swift implementation of  health policies took them from one of the worst in the US to one of the  best. Our models were able to predict and classify this phenomenon.  Future work in this area of prediction and classification of viral  spread will include misinformation and its impact on mitigation of viral spread. Our models are modular enough to integrate this extra element with relative ease.         Last Modified: 08/05/2022       Submitted by: Gil R Gallegos]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
