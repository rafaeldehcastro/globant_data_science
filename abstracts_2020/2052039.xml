<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is development of a novel technology platform for the treatment of bacterial pathogens that pose a persistent threat to plant health both in the field and during storage of the harvest. Many bacteria kill their host by forming biofilms on the plant surface. Central to this proposal are findings that biofilms confer tolerance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents, whether these antimicrobial agents are antibiotics, disinfectants, or germicides. Dispersing these biofilms is necessary to remove contaminating bacteria from the plant surface. This proposal is addressing these challenges by developing safe and natural biofilm degrading enzymes from the collection of over 3,000 unique microorganisms called Dictyostelids isolated from five continents and several island nations. The focus of this proof-of-principle project is discovery of enzymes for treatment of bacterial potato soft rot.  This disease is socially and commercially impacting our nation as potatoes are the most consumed vegetable in the U.S. with a total market value exceeding $3.5 B. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project advances the use of Dictyostelid strains capable of dispersing biofilms formed by Dickeya and Pectobacterium and feeding on planktonic bacteria liberated from the corresponding bacterial biofilms. To be able to destroy those biofilms they must be able to break down biofilm integrity. This project uses proprietary technology licensed to the firm for a world-wide use in the agricultural markets. Suspected members of Glycoside Hydrolase Family of enzymes (GHF) have been already identified by bioinformatics and in crude secreted products. This project has two objectives: (1) Using polynucleotide chain reaction it will amplify Dictyostelids DNA encoding GHF and clone it into an Escherichia coli compatible vector with an in-frame Histidine-Tag sequence for purification using a specialized affinity column, and (2) Affinity purified enzymes will be used to disperse Dickeya and Pectobacterium biofilms established on 96-well polystyrene plates. The best performing enzymes will be further examined for their ability to disperse biofilms on a potato surface and prevent soft rot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Current investigations that tackle biofilm forming agricultural pathogens are focused on some of the most important bacterial phytopathogens (e.g., <em>Pseudomonas syringae pathovars, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Xanthomonas oryzae, Xanthomonas campestris pathovars, Xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars, Erwinia amylovora, Xylella fastidiosa, Dickeya dadantii and solani, Pectobacterium carotovorum and Pectobacterium atrosepti</em>). These biofilms are tolerant not only against antibiotics but also against harsh disinfectants such as bleach, hydrogen peroxide, and quaternary ammonium as well as heavy metals such as copper. Copper is particularly important for the treatment of bacterial diseases in the organic produce industry since many commercial antimicrobials and resistant crops developed using genetic modification are not approved for organic use. Dispersing these biofilms is necessary to remove contaminating bacteria from the plant surface and unclog the vascular system so nutrients and water can freely flow. An important component of the biofilm matrix formed by many plant and human bacterial pathogens are polymeric carbohydrates such as cellulose.

With no effective treatments available for potato soft rot and blackleg, the potato industry suffers an average market loss of 0.57B-$1.13B per year. The value of U.S. potatoes has increased at a rate of approximately 1.7% per year, which is partly attributable to rising demand by countries in Asia.
