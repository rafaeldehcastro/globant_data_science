<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the development of a new wearable device, worn in the mouth like a dental retainer, mouthguard, or piercing. It will enable new interactions in  Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Mixed Reality (AR/VR/XR), but also serve as an assistive device to the 63 million people suffering from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), and physical injuries blocking people from using computers effectively. This will establish new markets for this type of wearable interface; unlock new human-machine interactions, both as a standalone device and paired with Head Mounted Display (HMD) systems; and expand new interfaces that are private, hands-free, heads-up, and taking better advantage of natural human intraoral/mental abilities. This will have significant impact for SCI/CTS users who will obtain the ability to use computers, as well as the large and emerging AR/VR/XR industries using HMDs hands-free/heads-up with private gestural interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the translation of a novel interface tool for the human mouth and tongue via an intraoral wearable solution.  It will exploit the fact that the largest dedicated areas of the brain’s sensory cortex and motor cortex are for hand, mouth, and tongue function. This interface adapts these already strong human oral abilities, connecting them to the digital world. This project will create a device to be worn like a dental retainer, where the device creates a haptic user interface with haptic patterns among which the user can feel and move, analogous to a touch screen navigated by tapping and swiping through visual icons and menus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The project team used NSF Phase I funding to develop a proof-of-concept of a new kind of intraoral (dental retainer-like) wearable for the mouth that can be used:   To navigate, using the tongue, the cursor on a remote computer screen, and    To communicate a haptic menu system that can be navigated non-visually and entirely within a user’s mouth.   Additionally, the project created testing infrastructure and baseline metrics for device navigation and communication efficacy, conducted extensive customer discovery in i-Corps and NSF Beat-The-Odds bootcamp, identified and pursued strategic partnerships for distribution, evaluated the manufacturing process and cost for multiple product form factors, and identified a suitable beachhead market for an initial consumer product based on this technology. Successful completion of Phase I development overcame significant technical risk and design barriers (combining proven and unproven technology in creative new ways), created useful new technology and new forms of interaction with computers, and advanced knowledge by enabling new horizons for the physicality of the mouth and large areas of the brain’s motor and sensory corticies that are dedicated to mouth movement and sensation. The team’s successful outcomes here have broad impacts for Human Computer Interaction in general, but also, critically, in creating new forms of interaction useful for people with hand, wrist, and disability issues (such as those living with hand paralysis or pain) to overcome barriers and challenges in modern daily living (as well as indirect impact for research and applications with non-human primates and other animals with dextrous and sensitive tongues).
