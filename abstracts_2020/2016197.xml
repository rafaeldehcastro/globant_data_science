<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the growth and processing parameters of a methane-reducing seaweed feed additive for ruminant livestock (i.e,. cattle). Globally, livestock methane emissions contribute up to 10% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.  Recent feed trials have determined that a special red tropical seaweed can help reduce the amount of methane produced by ruminants by over 98%. The proposed project will advance this as a feed additive at scale by exploring three novel solutions for natural lighting optimization in land-based cultivation systems, profiling and integrating aquaculture wastewater (AWW) as a circular nutrient stream, and deploying an alternative processing method to the energy-intensive industry standard. These growth processes can likely be applied to algae production for other uses, such as food, while drying innovations are expected to be broadly applicable in tropical climates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed SBIR Phase I project will build on work to grow Hawaiian Asparagopsis taxiformis in land-based systems and optimize for both yield and concentration of desired metabolites. Diurnal changes in solar position and irradiance, along with occlusion caused by algae self-shading, result in photosynthetic inefficiencies.  AWW contains large amounts of waste nitrogen and phosphorus; only 20-30% of nitrogen from the fish feed is retained in fish biomass. The integration of AWW will recover some of these nutrients and avoid downstream consequences of pollution, such as eutrophication. While drying material is important for the production of a shelf-stable product, existing technologies are either energy-intensive or perform poorly at retaining critical compounds in seaweed tissue. The project will test proposed solutions to this quandary, as well as contamination and strain development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Overview Symbrosiaâ€™s Phase I activities reduced modeled production costs of SeaGraze&trade;  at scale to $9.50/kg from approximately $85/kg through the following improvements: Photosynthesis optimization yielding up to 35% daily growth rate in outdoor photobioreactors, use of organic waste inputs yielding +9% daily growth rates compared to industrial chemical inputs which led to redefined media inputs for maximized yields and promotion of expedient growth of Asparagopsis taxiformis, final product formulation to mitigate metabolite loss and increase ease of use for consumers, and scaled formfactor development for modular growth on 10+ acres of non-arable land to simplify production procedures, improve yield, and cut energy costs.    Intellectual Merit Phase I implementations have decreased labor costs, defined chemical inputs to maximize productivity of Asparagopsis taxiformis, improved production predictability and output, and final product development processes that increase palatability and retention of key metabolites for reduction of methane emissions. Additionally, we continue to scale biological seaweed production through the implementation of automation based on Phase I deliverables and hydraulic designs that reduce energy costs in scaled form factor design specific to unique nuances catered to commercial production of A. taxiformis. These concepts are yet to be seen in a growing seaweed industry and could mark substantial technological progress in creating a reality where seaweed is a reliable, quality, industrial input that can be grown at scale in the United States.   Broader Impacts Beyond directly reducing methane emissions responsible for climate change with our product as heavily described in our Phase I proposal, Symbrosiaâ€™s team has prioritized community benefit with its maturation as described. We have initiated an internal transparent salary policy which ensures women and BIPOC team members are paid equal wages for equal labor. Symbrosia has undertaken substantial STEM education and community engagement opportunities through presentations with local marine organizations, facility tours, and increased STEM internship and FTE offerings. Through implementation of Phase I deliverables, we seek further development of open source automated agricultural production systems to provide the public the tools to design affordable, industrial-grade automation capacity within their operations.
