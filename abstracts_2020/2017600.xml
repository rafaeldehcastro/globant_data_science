<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This travel grant is used to support US based graduate students to attend the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Networking 2020 Conference, to be held in Paris, France from June 22 to June 26, 2020. The networking series of IFIP conferences is the IFIP Networking Conference, organized by the IFIP Technical Committee on Communication Systems (TC6), which initiated in 2000. The main objectives of the IFIP Networking conference are to bring together members of the networking community from both academia and industry, to discuss recent advances in the broad and quickly-evolving fields of computer and communication networks, and to highlight key issues, identify trends, and develop visions for the networking domain. Attending the IFIP Networking conference is highly valuable for graduate students. Not only will they be exposed to the state-of-the-art in the field, but they will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with leading researchers, and take part in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award encourages participation by students who would normally find it difficult to attend, and will play an important role in promoting diversity in the IFIP Networking conference attendees. The travel grants will target graduate students, in particular female and underrepresented minority students from minority-serving institutions that are not traditionally represented in the IFIP Networking conference. Priority will be given to the students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds, as well as junior graduate students who will attend the conference for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
