<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a process for the probiotics industry to reduce production costs and increase the selection of  products derived from natural and/or non-dairy ingredients. In addition, this innovation may positively impact agricultural industries by creating a new market for the waste byproducts generated during storage, transportation, and processing of agricultural products.  These byproducts represent a large proportion of the agricultural biomaterials and include eels, trimmings, stems, shells, bran, and seeds. Agricultural byproducts often end up in landfills, increasing the costs of disposal and creating environmental challenges. By creating a new market for these byproducts, this innovation may simultaneously reduce probiotic production costs, increase the income from agricultural production, reduce agricultural waste, and help protect the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores translation of a technology to convert agricultural byproducts into probiotic culturing media. To date, adoption of byproduct-based media has been limited by nutrient extraction processes that have relied on expensive chemical or enzymatic processes. The proposed technology reduces extraction cost by relying on a series of mechanical steps that requires only energy input. Reducing nutrient extraction costs enables adoption of probiotic culturing media.  Small- and medium-scale studies have demonstrated that probiotic strains may be cultivated at lower cost and with higher yield in this fashion.  In addition, experiments with several commercially available probiotic species  have shown similarly positive results in terms of cost, yield, and quality of the cultured material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Our target customers are probiotics manufacturers (PMs), such as Novagen, Winclave, and ADM.  PMs manufacture the probiotics that are packaged by supplement manufacturers (SM). The animal-based culturing solutions (ABCS) that many PMs rely on to produce their probiotics lead to: 1) low yields, 2) low shelf-lives, and 3) allergic reactions. In terms of yield, there are currently no solutions better than ABCSs.  Shelf-life problems are often ?solved? by overdosing (packing the supplement with more starting probiotics), a waste of material that could otherwise be used to generate more product.    2) We learned what the pain points of our target customer are.  SM customers demand the highest possible yields and shelf-lives from the PM because overdosing cannot be tolerated in the case of multi-strain formulations. Meanwhile, retailers are increasingly demanding non-allergenic products from SMs, a demand passed to PMs. PMs are therefore forced to switch from allergen-containing ABCSs to allergen-free chemical based solutions, which adds a tremendous downward pressure on yield and stability. PMs require a non-allergenic solution that will increase, not decrease, yield and stability.  3) We learned how our technology addresses the pain points of our target customers.  Our non-allergenic plant-based innovation solves problems 1, 2, and 3 by increasing yield by 200% and shelf-life by 50% with respect to ABCSs.   SMs will pay 2x the price to PMs for 2x the yield and an additional premium for a higher shelf-life.  4) We learned how our technology might be commercialized.  The size of the probiotics media market is $2 billion.  Our solution can double a PMs revenue and can therefore command a premium price (at least 20-30% more). Importantly, our raw materials will cost 2/3 less than those needed for ABCSs, lowering production costs.  5) We designed an MVP that better met target customer needs.  Here we designed a method to switch from a final freeze drying step to a spray drying step, which better met target customer requirements.  In short, we learned that there is a market fit for our technology, and that it makes sense to pursue commercialization of our technology. We look forward to carrying out further commercialization activities in order to place our technology in the market.
