<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Center for Quantum Technologies (CQT) is a partnership between Purdue University, Indiana University, the University of Notre Dame, and Indiana University Purdue University - Indianapolis (IUPUI).  The mission of the CQT is to collaborate with industry and government stakeholders to identify compelling needs and challenges in quantum technologies, and then develop novel solutions to address these opportunities. Quantum technologies are governed by the physics of sub-atomic particles and have relevance to computing, sensing, imaging, metrology, communications, and cryptography. Because of their wide-ranging applicability, quantum technologies have the potential to be transformative, with uses in intelligence, financial security, computing, medicine, and navigation. Society has entered the second quantum revolution, but it is still in its infancy, and the nascent quantum industry requires significant fundamental research to mature novel technologies. In partnership with industrial members, the CQT researchers will use their expertise in quantum science and engineering to develop and transfer foundational knowledge into industry-friendly quantum devices, systems, and algorithms with enhanced functionality and performance. Additionally, the CQT will help train the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers to support the development of a critically needed quantum workforce. Students will not only conduct Center research, but also help writing project reports, present at biannual meetings, and interact with industry and government members. Finally, the CQT will leverage established programs at each of the four universities to engage and support students traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, one of the four Center sites, the academic expertise in the fields of quantum materials, quantum sensing and quantum information will be meshed with the needs of industrial partners. Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis faculty excel in the development and characterization of novel quantum materials with unique properties that can be used both as platforms for quantum computation or as interfaces.  The researchers also explore novel schemes to improve sensing by using quantum materials, for example, by using optically trapped nanocrystals cooled to their ground state of translational motion or the exploitation of extraordinary points in parity-time (PT)-symmetric systems.  They also explore quantum information and key distribution, obtained in novel applications of photon entanglement scenarios. These approaches and methods have been developed recently within IUPUI in close collaborations with the existing Nanoscale Imaging Center and the Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute. A new Masters level program jointly developed by the School of Science and the School of Engineering &amp; Technology will incorporate existing courses in quantum science and technology and develop new curricular materials to better prepare graduates to join the workforce in these rapidly evolving fields. The Center will collaborate with the STEM Education Innovation and Research Institute (SEIRI), a hub for education innovation, research, evaluation and consultation in STEM disciplines and will directly interact with Project EPIC (Evidence-Informed Promotion of Inclusive Climate) to promote equity and diversity in STEM professions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
