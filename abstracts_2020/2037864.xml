<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative:  National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center).  The focus of a spectrum research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum. Ten researchers from six universities (Carnegie Mellon University, Iowa State University, Purdue University, University of Kansas, University of New Mexico and Wichita State University) and two government laboratory scientists with diverse background are coming together in this project with the goal of consolidating their on-going spectrum-related Research and R&amp;D efforts under an NSF SII-Center umbrella, to broaden the scope to address Grand Challenges in spectrum allocation, usage and utilization through coordination with collaborators, partners, beneficiaries and stakeholders. The proposed Center has three unique attributes: a. Particular focus on beyond terrestrial (space/satellite) communications, b. Exploration and integration of higher spectrum bands (e.g. W/V bands), and c. Protection of passive spectrum users and scientific missions.  The project also includes a comprehensive broader impact component including curriculum innovation and outreach to under-represented groups in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major activities of the project are the following: Centerâ€™s research will not only focus on terrestrial systems, but also space and satellite communications in higher-frequency spectrum-bands. Moreover, the Center research will specifically focus on both active and passive spectrum users from scientific missions such as those in astronomy, GPS, navigation and telemetry. Through partnerships with low-population density rural communities and native American pueblos, the Center will focus on developing innovative spectrum solutions for areas that lack broadband wireless access (BWA) due to unique regulatory, cultural, economic and market issues. Having established one of the few W/V band communications links anywhere in the world and having access to radio quiet sites such as the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) as a testbed, the Project Team brings unique spectrum-related research capabilities. The Center will focus on three R&amp;D priority areas that can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spectrum utilization through (1) spectrum agility, (2) near real-time spectrum awareness, and (3) adaptive spectrum decision making, which were recommended to the President by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in May 2019. In collaboration with our partners from government labs, the Center will contribute to global standardization and infrastructure enhancement for integrating future W/V band satellite and 5G/6G terrestrial wireless communications that will allow the US to lead the world in spectrum technology, utilization, and commercialization. The University of New Mexico is one of only two Hispanic-Serving Carnegie VH (Very High research activity) classified Research Universities in the nation. As such, establishing this SII-Center will broaden the participation in science of Hispanics and other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The key outcome of this SII Planning Grant was to submit a full NSF SII Center proposal by the deadline of 04/30/2021. The Planning Grant Team successfully submitted an NSF SII Center proposal to the NSF by assembling a diverse team made of 30 faculty members from 17 universities. The proposal, however, was not selected for Center funding.   For the SII Center proposal, the Team iIdentified 7 spectrum grand challenges that must be the focus of an NSF SII Center to meet NSFâ€™s outlined vision for such a Center that will lead to both effective and equitable spectrum coexistence between active and passive spectrum users and ensure US global leadership in spectrum technologies.   Spectrum research conducted under the support of this award included: Deployment of a Mobile Antenna for RFI Characterization and Mobile RFI Identification System (MARC MoRIS or just MARC for short) to the LWA1 site to assist with detection and mitigation of RFI from power lines, working with NRAO to clean up the low frequency RFI environment at the VLA site, developing theories identifying necessary and sufficient optimality conditions of the SGPM problem to mitigate/manage co-channel interference, developing a computationally scalable KM learning algorithm, based on the regularized dual optimization combined with enhanced gradient descent (GD) method, developing a novel channel estimator denoising method for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems consisting of a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates frequency domain signal information, developing a sequential decision-making approach for optimizing signal to interference ratios (SINR) in cellular networks containing intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS), and developing two-timescale hybrid federated learning (TT-HF) for distributed model training over the wireless edge, developing artificial intelligence based optimal trajectory finding algorithms for UAV mobile base stations to maximize coverage to distinct users.   Each of the planning grant participants hired either graduate students or post-docs and they were mentored and guided in their research on various aspects of spectrum technologies (both active and passive). Research results were broadly disseminated by submitting for publication in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology as well as several Professional conference proceedings.
