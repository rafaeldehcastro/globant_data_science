<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The growth of the United States STEM workforce is important to economic and global competitiveness.  Developing STEM talent among all sectors of society is needed in order to grow the workforce. This planning grant project includes a leadership team of experts from the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) and two Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs): The University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Arizona. The project leaders will engage dozens of HSIs and organization to build a collaborative infrastructure.  Together, the partners will pursue a consensus vision to address the broadening participation challenge of strengthening pathways to increase master’s and doctoral degree attainment in STEM fields for Latinx students attending HSIs. The outcomes of this planning grant are expected to lay the foundation for a future alliance, center or network to address the identified broadening participation challenge in STEM at a national scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning grant leadership team will engage dozens of HSI stakeholders, including administrative leaders, practitioners and faculty, and representatives from national organizations.  The project leaders will convene three regional meetings, one involving participants from the US South West, one engaging individuals on the US West Coast and another including representatives on the US East Coast.  The regional convenings will provide a forum for partnering organizations to build a robust collaborative infrastructure: To develop a shared vision; to expand the partnerships to include a broad community of organizations and institutions; to establish shared goals and metrics; to solidify the leadership structure; to establish and improve communication across the partners; and to scale or expand the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF INCLUDES planning grant is funded by the NSF’s Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science program (NSF INCLUDES), a comprehensive national initiative to enhance U.S. leadership in discoveries and innovations by focusing on diversity, inclusion and broadening participation in STEM at scale.  The planning grant is also funded by the NSF’s Hispanic Serving Institutions program (HSI); and the HSI program provides support to enhance the quality of undergraduate STEM education and to increase the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associates or baccalaureate degrees in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Hispanics are dramatically underrepresented in the U.S. STEM workforce, especially in positions that require advanced degrees. Given the concentration of Hispanic students in Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), the most effective strategy to increase Latinx graduate degree attainment is to focus on that set of institutions. This INCLUDES planning grant invited HSIs to a series of meetings: 1. To create a shared vision among Hispanic-Serving Institutions, including an understanding of key barriers and opportunities to Latinx graduate degree attainment, and a research and programming agenda to address these challenges; 2. To begin the process to create national partnerships through an infrastructure of regional hubs to facilitate future collaboration. A survey was sent to all HSIs in May 2021 to solicit their insight into barriers and opportunities to Latinx graduate degree attainment in STEM and their current program and partnerships to address this issue. 143 institutions responded. Two virtual two-day workshops were conducted in June 2021 with approximately 50 institutions participating in each. Through gallery walk activities highlighting promising practices gleaned from literature reviews, key-note speakers, industry panels, and break-out group discussion, a central set of promising practices was determined.  In September 2021 workshop participants were asked to submit a letter of interest if their institution would participate as a promising practice hub, a regional network hub, a research hub or an evaluation hub. Thirteen institutions submitted interest in being promising practice hubs, nine as regional network hubs, and four as research hubs. Following conversations with several submitting institutions, five (including one collaboration) institutions were selected to lead the promising practices: the University of New Mexico and the University of Nevada Las Vegas to lead holistic graduate review; the University of California Santa Cruz to lead anti-racist training relationships (mentoring); the University of California Santa Barbara to lead inclusive regional research collaborations; and the University of Arizona to lead culturally responsive leadership and pedagogies.  Two virtual meetings were held in October 2021 to allow the participants to get to know one another and present their preliminary plans for hub activities. An in-person meeting in Albuquerque, NM, Nov. 1-3, brought all participants together to solidify the project proposal going forward.  The following institutions were selected as regional network hubs to coordinate the dissemination of the promising practices in their regions: California State University Monterrey Bay, Concordia University (Texas), Los Angeles Mission College, Mira Costa College, Metropolitan State University (Colorado), Monclair University (New Jersey), Texas Lutheran University, the University of Arizona, and the University of New Mexico. The Center for Evaluation and Educational Effectiveness at California State University, Long Beach, was identified as a potential external evaluator. With funding saved from the transition from several in-person regional meetings to two national virtual meetings, an additional meeting brought together representatives from Texas institutions in September 2022 to further build connections among Texas HSIs around the critical need to better address institutional and inter-institutional support for Hispanic students in STEM. Although a proposal for a five-year INCLUDES grant received generally favorable reviews, it was not selected for funding. Participation in the workshops indicated a high level of interest and capability among HSIs to better address increasing Latinx participation in STEM degrees and careers. Many institutions referenced specific local programs already under way, especially the institutions noted as potential promising practice hubs. One of the clear goals for future work is developing stronger collaborative networks among institutions to assure smoother transitions for Latinx students from community college programs through doctoral programs.
