<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to reduce and prevent surface-based transmission of pathogens and thereby help public and institutional spaces become cleaner and safer, especially for at-risk populations. Hospital-acquired infections can be prevented by killing bacteria, molds, and fungi; and inactivating viruses on surfaces before they are able to pass to another person. The project will develop antimicrobial paints based on hydrogen peroxide (HP), which does not have toxic degradation products since it turns into water and oxygen. HP has a long history of safe use, without allowing generation of resistant strains of infectious organisms.  The paints can improve hygiene, and allow more efficient cleaning with peroxide-based agents, from which the paints can regenerate their antimicrobial efficacy, providing durable protection without highly toxic chemical applications. Competing antimicrobial paints are expensive, have not demonstrated long-term antimicrobial activity, or have used chemistries that carry the risk of developing microbial resistance. The proposed peroxide based antimicrobial paint will be more affordable, and very safe to implement, allowing regeneration of efficacy during cleaning. This will enable more widespread use in public health and institutional settings to help protect against transmissible infections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project addresses the technical challenge of developing an antimicrobial paint that can be regenerated, based on the use of HP in the formulation to achieve broad-spectrum antimicrobial and virucidal activity with long-term efficacy. This project leverages new technology to produce paint coatings that can sequester HP into a coated surface in a dry non-volatile form. This enables the slow release of HP over time that can be regenerated by exposure to commercially available solutions containing HP. HP degrades into innocuous products. Bacteria and viruses are not able to develop resistance to its disinfecting mechanism. Hence, the resulting product and its regeneration process will be long-lasting, cost-effective and environmentally safe. Technical challenges to be addressed in this project include ensuring formulation stability, antimicrobial and virucidal potency and recharging functionality of the paint, and the effects of HP on paint integrity. The team will closely collaborate with specialty coatings experts to develop and test viable paint formulations. Anticipated technical results include a prototype version of the technology, and documentation of the research outcomes and further regeneration requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The most innovative aspect of this paint additive is the ability to store Hydrogen Peroxide (HP) in a dry state for long periods of time to allow long-lasting antimicrobial activity by chemically bonding HP to <em>nano</em>-Zinc Oxide (ZnO), which stabilizes the HP into a dry form which can then be mixed into paints and other products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;A hospital-acquired infection (HAI) is an infection developed by a patient during a hospital visit, and are caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens.&nbsp; On any given day, about 1 in 31 hospital patients have at least one healthcare-associated infection. There were an estimated 687,000 HAIs in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2015, and 72,000 hospital patients with HAIs died during their hospitalizations. &nbsp;However, infection or contamination from surfaces is not restricted to hospital environments. High-touch surfaces, i.e., surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as those in public settings, represent a particular challenge. At schools, playgrounds, commercial &amp; office buildings, airports, mass transit, etc. there are surfaces that are touched constantly and that can contribute to the spread of pathogens. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased public awareness of the need for sanitized surfaces, and thus generated demand for similar products for home use by consumers. There is a clear need for technologies that contribute to the hygiene of healthcare settings, high occupancy facilities and homes.</p> <p>Quick-Med?s ZH-200 antimicrobial, when added to ordinary latex paint, creates a ?smart antimicrobial coating? that addresses the need for an effective, safe, regenerable, and affordable, germ-killing coating to help prevent the spread of infectious organisms.&nbsp; When mixed with commercial paint, the additive homogenizes in the mixture not altering the properties of the base paint. Once the paint has dried, in the presence of moisture and microbial insults, the HP sequestered within the coating is released in a controlled manner, in small amounts, creating a highly localized yet potent microbial killing zone.
