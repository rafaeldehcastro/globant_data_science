<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to quantitatively assess farmland status and resilience. This project studies varying agricultural productivity subject to weather and static soil and landscape properties. This study will develop models using artificial intelligence to make predictions.  It will be based on data from the U.S. and other agriculturally-intense regions of the world, allowing the generalization of the framework into new geographical domains. The models will also be tested on a variety of staple crops, such as corn, soybean, wheat, and rice.This system will include an interface for untrained users, as well as important data for quantitative financial analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop an integrative machine-learning framework consisting of state-of-the-art generative weather models, feature translation models, and crop yield models to obtain a rich ensemble of simulated growing season environmental conditions, and associated yield estimates. Supported by high-resolution satellite imagery in the past 20 years, the model is not only capable of capturing granular yield variability at the field scale, but also the heterogeneity of productivity within a crop field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Aspiring Universe (AU), after having initially conducted the NSF I-Corp project and identified the unmet needs of accurate and cost-effective farmland assessment for land appraisal and (re)insurance industry, applied for the NSF SBIR Phase 1 project in March 2020. AU was awarded the NSF SBIR Phase 1 funding, and officially started the project in Dec 2020. In the past one year, AU has accomplished all the major R&amp;D goals proposed in the Phase 1 proposal, based on which AU has successfully developed and launched the FarmScreen1.0 product. FarmScreen1.0 offers an accurate and unbiased report of farmland productivity history and in-season yield prediction, targeting land buyers and appraisals, as well as companies in the agricultural value chain which require in-season yield forecasts to manage their grain buying decisions. In particular, the following efforts have been accomplished by the AU team for this SBIR Phase 1 project:  (1) AU developed the database for the four major Corn Belt states to enable FarmScreen1.0 productization. This database includes field-level information of crop rotation pattern, historical crop yield, and sub-field-level crop productivity map that provide information for farming improvements.  (2) AU has developed an automatic computational pipeline to efficiently generate FarmScreen1.0 reports. This automatic pipeline builds upon the key database that we have developed in the previous task.  (3) AU developed the crop productivity ranking index. This new index provides stakeholders with a locally-calibrated measurement of the productivity of a field relative to fields with the same fixed conditions.  Besides the technical efforts, AU’s team also actively conducted business development for FarmScreen1.0. Our intensive business development efforts during the SBIR Phase 1 lead to multiple pilot projects with some of our targeted clients. Besides generating revenues, these pilot projects provide rich clients’ feedback and suggestions for improving and upgrading our product offerings. All these efforts pave a way for Aspiring Universe to move to SBIR Phase 2 application and further the commercialization development.
