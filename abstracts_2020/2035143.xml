<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will organize and host a workshop focused on the future of oceans. The conference aims to bring together stakeholders from numerous disciplines and organizations - spanning academia, industry, government, and foundations - in order to identify and explore avenues for collaborations in ocean innovation, exploration, and utilization. The goal is to develop a potential future topic (track) of the NSF Convergence Accelerator, identifying the potential scope of the topic, the potential deliverables that could result from supporting that topic, the disciplinary expertise that could come together under a convergence research approach, and the partnerships that could be engaged across academia, industry, foundations, and government if the topic were supported. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ocean is a primary source of food, energy, weather and climate stabilization, ecological diversity, and numerous other resources important to society. By identifying convergent approaches for ocean innovation, exploration, and utilization, this conference will have direct impact on sustainability concerns (energy, food, climate, pollution), national security matters (defense, risk assessment, marine technologies), and national industries (fishing, shipping, oil, energy, tourism).  Academia, industry, non-profits, and governments have increasing interest in ocean science and technologies due to emergent needs for ecological, defense, and industrial resources. The workshop will focus on convergent strategies to tackle ocean problems and emerging opportunities from three different lenses: technology, industry, and scientific disciplines. The topic has the potential to be strongly convergent, engaging disciplines across the physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Over the next decade, ocean industries and resources are expected to play a central role in addressing the nation’s (and the world’s) needs for energy, food, jobs, and sustainability. Indeed, these industries - collectively called the Blue Economy - already play an outsized role in the US economy. Unfortunately, despite pressing needs for innovation and integration, today’s Blue Economy remains far from its full potential due to the disconnected, fragmented, and often closed nature of its different sectors, technologies, and communities.    This project supported the creation of Smart Oceans 2020, a symposium that took place on October 5-9, 2020. The symposium brought together over 1,700 participants from more than 400 institutions, spanning academia, private industry (including startups), government agencies, and nonprofits. The symposium featured plenary and lightning talks by thought leaders who highlighted the emergent paradigm of ocean IoT and convergent ideas and challenges aligned with this paradigm.

Based on the conference proceedings and engagement, we proposed an NSF C-Accel track on "Ocean Internet-of-Things" (IoT) to interconnect the Blue Economy and accelerate convergence across ocean sectors. This track aims to create, within 1-3 years, a smart, integrated, connected, and open ecosystem for ocean innovation, exploration, and sustainable utilization. Such an ecosystem is necessary to address the pressing needs highlighted by multiple national and international reports on ocean observation, mapping, and sustainability, including from the National Academy of Engineering, the White House Ocean Policy Committee, the US Department of Energy, and the UN Decade of Ocean Science.
