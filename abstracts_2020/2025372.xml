<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Hurricanes severely disrupt the food supply for island communities by destroying domestic agricultural production capacity and crippling the infrastructure for food importation, transportation, and cold storage. This can decimate the livelihood of local farmers and greatly complicate the logistics and expense of providing fresh produce to residents in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, and to the important tourism industry in the longer term. Microgrid-supported hydroponic crop cultivation (MSHCC) may be able to mitigate this threat to food security for island communities. The investigators for this proposal have built an MSHCC prototype and seek to show proof-in-principle of efficacy in the Bahamas in response to Hurricane Dorian. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are: i) to determine how MSHCC can foster climate resilience through sustainable agriculture and energy solutions in small island communities, and ii) determine how these social enterprises can build economic opportunity by equipping residents with the tools they need to supply emergency food providers and the tourism industry with locally grown food. This project brings rigorous scholarship to the humanitarian engineering application of HCC in the case of hurricane resilient food supplies and livelihoods in small island communities, using the hurricane-damaged country of the Bahamas as a case study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

NSF# 2025372.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hurricanes can cause devastating damage to the food supply in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from intense winds, storm surge and flooding from heavy rainfall. This can destroy existing crops, contaminate the soil and public water supply with polluted flood water, and compromise wells used for irrigation by saltwater intrusion. This damage is expected to become more frequent and severe as climate change contributes to more powerful hurricanes in the tropics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>SIDS import over 60% of their food supply with the rest provided by small-scale farms and fisheries. Hurricanes also damage the air, sea, and land infrastructure for food imports, as well as the cold storage for food preservation. Thus, food insecurity is a significant risk for SIDS during the hurricane season and the long period it can take to recover from hurricane damage.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project investigates Hydroponic Crop Cultivation (HCC) to reduce the risks of food insecurity and loss of livelihood to small-scale farmers in SIDS due to hurricanes. HCC grow by suspending their roots in a nutrient solution, so they do not require soli to grow. HCC systems can produce crops of leafy green vegetables and vine fruit, such as tomatoes, with up to 75% less land and 90% less water in half the time of conventional crop cultivation (CCC) in the soil. However, HCC is highly energy intensive relative to CCC because it needs to pump a nutrient rich solution continuously through the system in which the roots of the crop are suspended.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>The goals of our project were i) to determine how MSHCC can foster climate resilience through sustainable agriculture and energy solutions in SIDS, and ii) determine how these social enterprises can build economic opportunity by equipping residents with the tools they need to supply emergency food providers and the tourism industry with locally grown food</em></strong>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project thus faced three major challenges. The first was to provide an affordable and reliable energy supply that would work even if grid electricity was lost in the hurricane. The second was to make the HCC system resistant to the wind and water damage from a typical hurricane. The third was to make the system attractive to and capable of being built and operated by small-scale farmers in SIDS.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our project was developed in response to 2017 Hurricane Maria for testing in the Bahamas as a model for SIDS. However, 2019 Hurricane Dorian, Covid-19, and 2022 Hurricane Ian prevented local implementation of our design. We had arranged to work with the Bahamas Agriculture and Marine Science Institute to train small-scale farmers in building and operating the HCC systems using local resources. A Bahamian nonprofit (offered to purchase the HCC crops from farmers and sell them to supplement supplies of fresh vegetable during emergencies. They would sell to commercial establishments during regular times. Instead, the model was built and tested at the University of Virginia by groups of engineering students over a three-year period (2019 ? 2022).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We used a solar powered microgrid to solve the energy supply challenge. Thus, we developed a Microgrid-Supported Hydroponic Crop Cultivation system (MSHCC). We integrated a system to capture rainwater or to use evaporated flood or seawater for the nutrient solution. Finally, we developed a platform that could support the HCC system. It could be folded shut to protect the system from Category 3 hurricane winds and could float around an anchor to withstand up to 10 feet of flood water.&nbsp; The solar powered microgrid with battery storage could power the irrigation pump with extra power for a small refrigerator to store emergency medicines and to charge a cellphone and laptop computer for up to 72 hours.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/20/2023<br>      Modified by: Garrick&nbsp;E&nbsp;Louis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2025372/2025372_10658881_1695232280395_Image1g--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2025372/2025372_10658881_1695232280395_Image1g--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MSHCC Prototype 1: 2019-2020."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2025372/2025372_10658881_1695232280395_Image1g--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MSHCC Prototype 1: 2019-2020."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Basic HCC Unit with Solar Power</div> <div class="imageCredit">G.E.
