<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Gulf of Maine is located in the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean. Its waters serve as home to the economically important Atlantic Cod and shellfish industry.  But recent changes to this environment pose a threat to the ecosystem and the commercial fishing industry.  However, only a few long-term records of the environment exist in this area making it difficult to tell exactly when these changes started and how much is related to human activities.  In this project, a team of researchers from three universities will construct a 250-year history of the regional environment by measuring yearly growth bands in local clams and algae.  Chemical fingerprints in these growth bands will be used to determine the water temperature, salinity, biological productivity and pH conditions. This allow scientists to study how natural changes have affected the environment and compare these to changes caused by greenhouse global warming.  This information will inform policy decisions of the newly-formed Maine Climate Council on how to better manage this area. The proposed work will also support training for early career scientists, broaden participation in science programs, and support undergraduate research opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the team will use a multi-pronged approach using geochemical proxies in two types of high-resolution marine climate archives (clams and crustose coralline algae) to reconstruct past changes in oceanographic conditions, including near surface seawater temperatures, salinity, and pH in the Gulf of Maine through the last 250 years. Geochemical fingerprints (or proxies) preserved in the annual growth bands of clam shells and skeletons of long-lived marine calcifiers have been used extensively as archives of past ocean conditions. Discrete calcium carbonate layers can be sampled from the growth bands of clams and crustose coralline algae for geochemical analysis, generating proxy archive records. These reconstructions of past environmental conditions fill data gaps prior to instrumental records. Hence, the proposed research will potentially yield several multi-centennial, annually-resolved, absolutely-dated datasets of oceanographic variability in the Northwestern Atlantic, including the Gulf of Maine, prior to the Industrial Revolution, which will be used to evaluate the role of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and other climate forcings, on observed changes. By combining new data derived from traditional and novel proxies with existing hydrographic records, the relative contributions of source waters into the Gulf of Maine through time will be characterized to better understand the drivers of variability within the Gulf of Maine. Understanding past oceanographic variability in the Gulf of Maine is therefore critical for predicting the likely extent and magnitude of future change, and for planning to safeguard ecosystems and fisheries. Results will be widely disseminated to science and non-science audiences through publications, conference presentations, mentoring programs, coursework, and outreach activities at area schools, museums, and science centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
