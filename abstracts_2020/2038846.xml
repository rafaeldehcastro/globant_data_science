<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Computational and data science skills have become essential in making scientific discoveries, especially in fields where the integration of diverse sources of observational and modeled data is required to understand the mechanisms and functions of complex systems, such as the Earth’s ocean. However, conventional ocean sciences education focuses predominantly on domain-specific knowledge and often falls short in explicitly incorporating these operational skills into the curriculum. The PIs will plan and host several workshops, a virtual workshop in 2020 and two in-person workshops in 2021, that aim to address this urgent need by combining immersive tutorials on state-of-the-art data science methodologies, peer-learning, and on-site collaborative hack project work in a 5-day intensive workshop. This is a domain-specific adaptation of the “hackweek” model, which has emerged in the computational data science community as a powerful model for educating new users, sharing technical expertise, and building an inclusive and cohesive community. The focus of the workshops is the use of ocean data, and specifically the use of data from the NSF-funded Ocean Observatories Initiative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops, called "OceanHackWeek2020-2021", provide an avenue for expediting the adoption of data science methodologies and computational tools for data-intensive research in the ocean sciences community. These skills are indispensable for modern-day oceanographers to tackle complex scientific questions by harnessing the data revolution. OceanHackWeek differs from traditional academic conferences and one-off hackathons by its immersive curriculum, collaborative learning environment, and a set of carefully crafted participant selection criteria that helps promote diversity and inclusivity. These designs help spur collaborative interdisciplinary ideas and help promote best data science practices in ocean sciences. OceanHackWeek focuses not only on promoting data science literacy but also on building an inclusive and cohesive community of oceanographers for learning and sharing. The organizers encourage and empower participants to bring the skills gained and the sense of community formed during the hackweek back to their own labs and institutions. Beyond the intensive in-person workshop, OceanHackWeek tutorials will be maintained as persistent open online resources to allow anyone to partake and self-learn. By facilitating and catalyzing the growth and change of individuals through grassroot efforts that promote and embrace a diverse community, OceanHackWeek drives cultural change in the field of oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
