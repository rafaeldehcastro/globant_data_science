<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project examines the relative effects of human capital signaled by prison work certificates and a criminal record on labor market outcomes.  It also investigates whether these effects vary according to demographic category.  The study will advance understanding of how employers evaluate and weigh prison certifications when making hiring decisions and the ways formerly incarcerated men navigate the job search process with credentials that send potentially contradictory signals to employers.  Findings will be relevant to the provision and structure of prison credentialing programs and ways decision makers and practitioners can best prepare incarcerated men for the labor market.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data for this project will be collected through: 1) an audit study via online submission of manipulated resumés to employers and 2) interviews with 50 employers and 50 formerly incarcerated people.  In the resumés, possession of a prison apprenticeship certificate and demographic characteristics are manipulated.  Interviews with employers inquire about qualities they perceive help formerly incarcerated people overcome records, precautions taken with formerly incarcerated people who possess prison certifications, and attitudes regarding the quality of prison training. Interviews with formerly incarcerated men ask about prior and current work experience, job satisfaction, motivations for obtaining prison certifications, and the usefulness of prison training in their everyday work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

I began conducting interviews with employers from the audit.     Project Findings   For research objective one, I found that certificates from prison alleviate some of the criminal stigma in the labor market, but do not allow formerly incarcerated men to compete with men without criminal records for jobs. Employers were less likely to call back formerly incarcerated men with certificates than men without criminal records, even the underqualified applicant. While I did not find that employers evaluated Black and White men’s certificates from prison differently when deciding whether to call them in for a job interview, I did find strong effects of applicants’ race (signaled via their names) on callback rates. That is, White men had twice the chance of receiving a call back than their Black counterparts, which resulted in White formerly incarcerated men with certificates faring better than Black applicants without criminal records.

I will continue conducting interviews and developing these preliminary findings.     Intellectual Merit  This project has contributed to sociological and criminological research by offering a theoretical alternative explanation for mixed research regarding the efficacy of certificates from prison. It also addressed key methodological limitations of previous research by incorporating both an audit experiment and qualitative interviews with both employers and formerly incarcerated people with certificates from prison. The audit study allowed me to isolate the effect of race/racism (indicated by applicants’ names) and having a certificate (from prison or a local training center) on callbacks from employers in their real-world hiring contexts. Qualitative interviews with formerly incarcerated people allowed me to systematically understand how certificates from prison helped (and hindered) their search for work. Qualitative interviews with employers provided information about their evaluation processes and knowledge gaps that might be filled with assumptions about applicants with certificates from prison.     Broader Impacts  The project has already had broader impacts because of the institutional support and efforts of the co-PI. One practical implication of the first research article from this project (objective two) published in Criminology was to ensure that all facilities removed any mention of the institution on the certificate. The results from this first study alone have been shared with practitioners, policymakers and staffers via coverage in The Hill and The Conversation, the public via podcasts, and formerly incarcerated people themselves. For instance, the Connecticut Department of Corrections plans to incorporate the implications from the first study into the State’s Fair Chance Hiring Toolkit.
