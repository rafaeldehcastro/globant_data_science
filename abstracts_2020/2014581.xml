<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to regenerate coral reefs on the brink of extinction. Approximately one-quarter of the worldâ€™s coral reefs have disappeared and almost two-thirds are at risk today. The innovation introduces a scalable method to plant heat-resistant corals to rejuvenate dying reefs. The technology is a multi-arm dexterous robot crawler. Planting one nursery coral every 10 seconds, with a cluster of three robots, the technology is capable of planting 100x faster than any method currently in use. This intervention will have a direct and beneficial impact on environmental restoration, marine ecosystems, and the tourism industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will design a coral planting robot that traverses the ocean floor and performs complex tasks. Challenges include creating an autonomous wet chain and producing a wet chain sled, as well as addressing recharging difficulties.  Planting must take place where the coral is bound sufficiently so that it is not dislodged by waves or currents. Other technical challenges include identifying exposed hard surfaces as well as healthy coral to leave it undisturbed.  This project will enable reintroduction of key species with different environmental tolerance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The Phase 1 work of the project was successful in advancing the state of the art of coral planting technology and in developing relationships for commercialization and partnerships with other groups in the production chain of the industry.  Phase I Conclusions Under Phase 1 funding, Reefgen rapidly developed key components of a robotic system to plant corals from a nursery in a hard substrate under water. We also built a functional coral planting robot. In six months, we were able to assemble COTS components and in-house fabricated parts into a system that actually can plant a coral in the ocean. We also developed a method, process, and devices to attach the corals to reefs instantaneously, which was not previously possible. With a solid dedication to field testing every innovation as we made it, we were able to test all of our hardware regularly. Through our field program, we demonstrated coral disk planting, both in the lab and in the ocean. Multiple times we were able to complete the cycle of preparing a hard surface and attaching a coral.   We applied for and received an extension period for Phase 1 work on Reefgen.
