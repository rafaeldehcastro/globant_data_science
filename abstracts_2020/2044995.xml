<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[E4TheFuture and UC Berkeley’s Transportation Sustainability Research Center are partnering to develop a mobility hub strategy to overcome spatial mismatch between low-to-moderate income (LMI) housing/jobs in Providence, Rhode Island and Blackstone River Valley. Limited public transit presents challenges in securing/maintaining meaningful employment for marginalized community members lacking personal transportation. This multi-phase project advances NSF’s mission to improve quality of life by enhancing LMI household mobility to jobs, healthcare, etc.   Employing groundbreaking research to better understand LMI decision- making for transportation and job access, the project takes a non-prescriptive approach to community engagement. It develops a replicable process for co-creating mobility strategies through active community engagement, pairing mobility strategies with human services (e.g., mobility training, workforce development) to connect residents with jobs and/or apprenticeships. The project develops strategies to scale/sustain the project beyond the pilot and a design toolkit that documents engagement, research methods, and data analysis tools that other communities can employ.  The project team is multidisciplinary and includes academic partners (Boston University, Brown University, and University of California Berkeley) and community organizations (Mobility Development, Building Futures RI, a workforce/apprenticeship development organization, and local affordable housing community based organizations Preservation of Affordable Housing, and NeighborWorks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project employs a community-based participatory mixed-method research approach that responds to participant needs and reflects community desires, demonstrates a pathway to sustainability (longer-term financial viability of mobility business models) and develops a pilot evaluation model.  The project combines qualitative (focus groups, listening sessions) and quantitative (survey, US Census) data to spatially analyze relationships among daily mobility challenges and existing transport systems, create mobility strategies and training materials, and develop a sustainable model and pilot evaluation.  This project also has a significant spatial component, integrating participatory mapping procedures with qualitative data collection methods. Engagement frameworks, methods, data, and analysis tools developed as part of this initiative will inform future planning, pilot projects, mobility business models, and research. All materials will be available in a toolkit for use by other communities.  This replicable strategy incorporates challenges impacting employment, which are often omitted from typical mobility assessments. Considering these daily struggles in the mobility hub design, the Stage 2 pilot will foster broader societal outcomes including: 1) Advancement of apprenticeships, employee attendance, job retention/creation (key metrics); 2) Participation of underrepresented populations; 3) Changes in modes used; 4) Vehicle miles traveled/air quality impacts; and, 5) Quality of life.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the CIVIC Innovation Challenge program Track A. Communities and Mobility: Offering Better Mobility Options to Solve the Spatial Mismatch Between Housing Affordability and Jobs through a collaboration between NSF and the Department of Energy Vehicle Transportation Office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

These efforts resulted in the development of a co-created mobility apprenticeship strategy that helps address the spatial mismatch between good quality, &ldquo;high road&rdquo; jobs and affordable places to live in Providence and Woonsocket, Rhode Island.</p> <p>The community meeting revealed that commonly used transportation modes included personal vehicles, public transportation systems, and bicycles. Key challenges identified revolved around access (e.g., fare affordability, to resources such as grocery stores) and safety (e.g., on bike paths, at bus stops). These mobility challenges impacted participants&rsquo; job and career opportunities, childcare options, and healthcare providers as well as personal stress and travel times. The predominant concern for participants was a lack of vehicle ownership that impeded employment opportunities. To address these concerns, the participants expressed a desire for shared mobility options including electric bikesharing, free bus fares, and electric vehicle carsharing. Participants wanted these services in destination areas (e.g., Main Street, hospitals, universities) with information in various foreign languages (e.g., Cambodian, Korean, Portuguese) with alternatives for individuals with mobility impairments.</p> <p>The focus groups also revealed a number of mobility challenges accessing jobs and critical services (e.g., healthcare, healthy food, childcare). These mobility challenges were caused by: 1) limited spatial and temporal public transit service access; 2) poor public transit connections resulting in multiple transfers and excessive wait and journey times; and 3) built environment obstacles, such as the I-95 and I-195 interstates, that impeded walkability. Participants expressed the need for affordable and reliable transportation options to &ldquo;high road&rdquo; jobs, which could build ladders of opportunity and economic mobility. These needs could be met through strategies including: developing mobility and employment counseling (to help identify transportation options to workforce development opportunities), providing shared micromobility (i.e., bikesharing, scooter sharing) options, and increasing carpooling and vanpooling availability. Particularly given virus transmission concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, shared micromobility and pooling options were viewed as &ldquo;safer&rdquo; (i.e., lower risk of virus transmission) than public transit alternatives.</p> <p>The expert interviews revealed that stakeholders are also interested in exploring new shared mobility options (e.g., bikesharing, carsharing). However, these services require additional support (e.g., improved active transportation infrastructure, equitable access for different communities). The experts supported non-vehicle based and lower emission modes, in particular. However, the stakeholders voiced concerns about a lack of effective communication, especially for lower income communities, and accessibility (e.g., wheelchair accessible vehicles). Collectively, the stakeholders were interested in developing partnerships and engaging with new organizations and programs to create a more equitable, robust, and environmentally friendly transportation network.</p> <p>The research efforts resulted in the proposal of a mobility and apprenticeship program that includes<strong>: </strong>1) providing low-income residents with mobility options to access key resources (e.g., &nbsp;apprenticeships/jobs, healthy food, shopping); 2) measuring/analyzing the benefits of a six-month pilot for individuals and employers; 3) developing a replicable project framework for apprenticeship/workforce programs that could be applied in communities across the country; 4) deploying gamification/incentives experiments that reinforce adoption and sustain positive transportation behavioral shifts; 5) advancing policy innovations in the area of apprenticeships (e.g., securing an exemption to personal transportation requirements for construction apprenticeships through transportation demand management strategies); and 6) developing a sustainable business model strategy.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/14/2021<br>      Modified by: Susan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Buchan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2044995/2044995_10717108_1631643068991_ProjectOutcomesFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2044995/2044995_10717108_1631643068991_ProjectOutcomesFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project Team (Figure 1)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2044995/2044995_10717108_1631643068991_ProjectOutcomesFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project Team (Figure 1)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The image depicts the initial four layers of the project team: 1) Core Team (i.e., research and project management), 2) Key Collaborators (i.e., employer and workforce development partners), 3) ) Supporters (i.e., low-income community outreach and engagement organizations),  4) Advisory Support.</div> <div class="imageCredit">E4TheFuture</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Susan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Buchan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project Team (Figure 1)</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
