<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve math education by integrating cognitive and behavioral approaches to learning. This project will develop a novel data-driven approach to understanding the underlying root cause of students' mathematics struggles to enable appropriate interventions in a practical solution addressing the needs of educators of all grade levels and content.  This will be particularly important in a virtual learning environment, such as that generated in the COVID-19 crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates cognitive, behavioral, and learning research. The innovation will add measures of self-control to existing cognition measures.  This development is important because of the high variation in behavioral responses across learners. This innovation is expected to help develop independent, self-regulated learners by enabling the delivery of evidence-based teaching (EBT) with fidelity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
