<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Decision-makers and the general public rely on models to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread and predict the number of infections and fatalities. Model predictions are critical to rapidly develop policy interventions that mitigate COVID-19, to anticipate impacts on health care resources, and to strategize how best to impose and lift public health guidelines. Existing COVID-19 models produce radically different predictions, thus creating confusion and mistrust over their use. Therefore, there is an urgent need to compare between the wide-range of existing COVID-19 models and their predictions. The goal of this project is to find a consensus among various model predictions and to make the different model assumptions and uncertainty transparent. An interactive web-based dashboard will serve as an open and accessible tool to inform the public, fellow researchers, and decision-makers where existing models agree and disagree on predictions. The predictions that are agreed upon by existing models can then be used with greater confidence and trust as the basis for effective decision-making to save lives and resources. Apart from the practical importance for the implementation of effective pandemic control measures and public health strategies, other broader impacts are professional development opportunities for early career researchers and training opportunities for a post-doctoral scholar. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find a consensus among various model predictions, this project will develop a novel ensemble prediction approach that (1) aligns different COVID-19 simulation models and (2) uses a time series clustering technique to unify model predictions. In the model alignment stage, a range of open-source and publicly available COVID-19 simulation models will be selected, aligned based on their parameters, and run as needed. A broad set of predictions will be obtained from the model results, where each prediction represents a possible world with a corresponding number of new cases, fatalities, and other quantities of interest. The time series clustering stage will project possible worlds into a feature space and apply clustering algorithms to find similar possible worlds. For each cluster, a representative possible world will be selected, enriched with measures of uncertainty, and visualized using the dashboard. This project advances the theoretical knowledge base for model alignment approaches and representative uncertain clustering for simulation model predictions. The unification of model predictions into a scientific consensus can be used to inform decision-makers better so that they can develop life-saving interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have made efforts to develop realistic simulation models that predict the number of COVID-19 deaths and evaluate the effectiveness of policy interventions. However, these models are developed based on a variety of approaches and thus produce radically different predictions, creating confusion among policymakers and the public about the severity of the situation and how best to respond.  Therefore, our key objectives included: (1) the implementation of a novel ensemble modeling approach that can be used to combine predictions from multiple models into a consensus, (2) the design and development of an interactive web-based dashboard to serve as an open and accessible tool for users to compare between models, (3) the provision of mentorship and research opportunities for students at a range of academic levels and (4) engagement with the broader public, the modeling community, and policymakers.  (1)  Ensemble Modeling Approach  One objective of this project was to combine predictions from a variety of models that simulate the spread of COVID-19. This is a challenging endeavor because the temporal resolution of the forecasts (i.e. the predicted number of COVID-19 deaths over time) is inconsistent from model to model. The project results reveal that an approach referred to as data imputation can be used to fill in the gaps in model predictions to overcome this challenge. Specifically, for every model, given a from-date and to-date, imputation allows us to estimate how many deaths that the model would predict, even if the raw model data is not explicitly available. In essence, we have devised methods to ?predict the predictions?. Leveraging this model of imputation, we investigated ways to use machine learning approaches to combine predictions into a consensus that minimizes the deviation from the (later) observed ground truth. However, our investigated models are outperformed by state-of-the-art ensemble modeling. This is still ongoing and promising work with many potential interesting research directions.  (2)  Interactive Dashboard  We have developed and made available an open and accessible web-based dashboard (https://covid-ensemble.gmu.edu) called the COVID-19 Ensemble Dashboard that allows users to compare between predictions generated by a wide range of models as well as visualize the degree of uncertainty/confidence levels associated with those predictions. The COVID-19 Ensemble Dashboard will both improve knowledge discovery and support decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks.  (3)  Student Mentorship and Research Training  Our team made it a priority to provide research experience and mentoring for a range of students at all levels of academia. Apart from the PIs, our research team has consisted of a postdoctoral researcher, five graduate student researchers, eight undergraduate researchers, and nine high school research interns. These students were mentored as a part of the Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program and the Provost?s Summer Team Impact Projects at George Mason University over two summers (2020-21). Students received training to build skills including scientific writing, engagement with the professional scientific community, and the communication of research and results.

At this time, of the five papers, three are published and two are under review. An additional publication, led by the postdoctoral researcher, is in writing.  (4)  Engagement with Broader Public, Modeling Community, and Decision Makers   COVID-19 response requires interdisciplinary collaboration and strong ties with stakeholders in public health. The project PIs have worked to develop multi-institutional synergies and collaborations with experts in epidemiology, social behavioral and economic sciences, and computer sciences. Examples of synergistic activities include the organization of interdisciplinary workshops, seminars, and conferences (namely the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Modeling and Understanding the Spread of COVID-19 and the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Spatial Computing for Epidemiology) and the and editorial roles in a journal special issues such as ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems Special Issues on Special Issue on Understanding the Spread of COVID-19 that call for interdisciplinary collaboration towards pandemic preparedness and response. Additionally, we have connected with various stakeholders in public health such as Fairfax County, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), and the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) with the aim to shift research into practice and foster new research directions.  (5)  Other Outcomes  Other achievements include methodological advancements including improving simulation models of COVID-19 spread and leveraging novel spatiotemporal datasets to understand the spread of COVID-19 better.
