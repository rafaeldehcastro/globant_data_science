<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the degradation, waste and shortage of stored blood.  This project proposes a blood bag capable of preserving the overall health and vigor of stored blood, including rare blood types, and extending the shelf life of blood and platelets.  Donated blood begins to degrade on day 11 and expires on day forty-two.  Platelets expire within 5-7 days of storage.  By increasing the shelf-life of healthy blood, the proposed technology decreases waste and addresses the shortage of blood supplies around the world. The current global blood shortage is 30 M units per year, and 18 M units of donated blood are wasted due to expiration. Globally, 400 M people with rare blood types don't have consistent access due to the cost of frozen rare blood.  Degradation in red blood cells due to oxygen exposure and other factors begin as early as days 11 - 21 after collection, impacting post-transfusion recovery by increasing mortality, serious infections, multi-organ failure, thrombosis, and the length of the hospital stay. Increasing the functional health of stored human blood and extending its viability beyond forty-two days will dramatically impact the health of patients around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to develop new polymer nanocomposite-based plastics and blood bags by using the anti-oxidative and antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles within the composite plastic. The three main objectives of the proposed Phase 1 project are to develop functional polymer nanocomposite plastics and films, determine the effect of nanoparticles on human RBCs and platelets in response to storage and to develop a prototype polymer nanocomposite blood bag and test its efficacy to increase the shelf life and functional health of human blood and platelets. The project applies interdisciplinary tools to advance polymer nanocomposite bags while taking into consideration stringent requirements of physicochemical and mechanical properties for this unique application. The challenge is to balance the essential requirements of a blood bag while ensuring the efficacy with no leaching of nano materials during blood storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
