<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Topology is a subject of mathematics that studies the shape of spaces, and homotopy theory studies how spaces can be deformed to each other without tearing things up or puncturing holes in the process. Among all spaces, the spheres are the most fundamental and beautiful objects. A central question in homotopy theory and algebraic topology - the computation of homotopy groups of spheres - is to understand how spheres can be mapped to other spheres, in different dimensions, and to understand how different maps can or cannot be deformed to each other. This topological question is not just a fundamental question on fundamental mathematical objects, but it also has deep connections and interactions to other subjects in mathematics. It has been a major research question since 1950's. For example, Kervaire and Milnor established a connection to the question on how many ways one could do calculus on spheres - smooth structures on spheres; Kervaire and Browder built a connection to the question on how one could or could not do surgeries to higher dimensional spaces to turn them into spheres - the Kervaire invariant problem. Moreover, a summand of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, the image of J, is closely related to the Bernoulli numbers; Quillen and Goerss, Hopkins, Miller, Lurie established a connection to the moduli stack of formal groups. More recently, Hill, Hopkins, Ravenel, Voevodsky, Morel, Isaksen and others established connections between equivariant homotopy theory and motivic homotopy theory. The goal of this project is to deepen the existing connections, as well as discovering new connections by pushing further the limit of existing ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research concentrates on computations of stable homotopy groups of spheres, with interactions among motivic, equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory, and applications to problems in differential topology, such as uniqueness of smooth structure on spheres and the Kervaire invariant problem. More specifically, in current and ongoing projects with Isaksen and Wang, the Principle Investigator (PI) develops new computational tools in motivic homotopy theory, with connection to chromatic homotopy theory, which computes 40 more new stems of classical stable homotopy groups of sphere within two years. The PI will deepen the new connection between motivic homotopy theory and chromatic homotopy theory, carry out more computations of stable stems in the next a few years, and use the computations to attack the last unsolved case of the Kervaire invariant problem in dimension 126. The PI will also explore connections between real motivic homotopy theory and C2 equivariant homotopy theory, following ongoing work of Behrens, Dugger, Guillou and Isaksen. The goal is to prove structural theorems in this direction, as well as providing concrete computational results. In ongoing projects with Hill, Shi and Wang, the PI will also apply equivariant techniques, such as the slice spectral sequences that are developed by Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, to do computations in heights greater than 2 in chromatic homotopy theory and to understand its connection to stable homotopy groups of spheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The P.I. completed a variety of research projects in motivic and equivariant stable homotopy theory, with an emphasis on the computations of stable homotopy groups of spheres.      The P.I.'s work with his collaborators was focused on developing new techniques in motivic homotopy theory to study the classical problem of computations of stable homotopy groups of spheres. Motivic stable homotopy theory is a subject that has successfully applied abstract homotopy theory to solve problems in number theory and algebraic geometry. The P.I. and his collaborators have reversed this information flow---using motivic stable homotopy theory, the computation of classical stable homotopy groups of spheres, a fundamental problem in topology, has been extended into a much larger range. In particular, the P.I. and his collaborators introduced and studied a t-structure on the cellular motivic stable homotopy category over the complex numbers, and identified its heart as a well known abelian category that is central to chromatic homotopy theory. These works include published papers in the very topic journals Acta Mathematica and PNAS. One other preprint was submitted for publication.     The P.I. and his collaborators also studied a few Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel type spectra through the equivariant slice spectral sequence. In particular, the P.I. and his collaborators gave a complete computation of the slice spectral sequence of a height-4 Lubin-Tate theory and learned that its homotopy groups are 384-periodic. These works include a published paper in Advances in Mathematics and a paper accepted for publication in Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society.     Besides, the P.I. and his collaborators also have one paper published in Algebraic and Geometric Topology, and four papers posted on the arXiv and submitted for publication.     The P.I. was awarded the 2018 ICCM Best Paper Award, which was given to 30 papers per year co-authored by Chinese descendants, and was selected by a global scientific committee. This NSF grant was used to support the MIT topology seminar during the academic year 2018 to 2019 for outside speakers. During the period of this grant the P.I. co-organized one summer school and two international workshops on homotopy theory.
