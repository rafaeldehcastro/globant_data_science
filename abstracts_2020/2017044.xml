<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Social and human services in the United States are increasingly provided by nonprofit organizations. Access to these services is crucial to ensure the health and welfare of individuals and their families. However, nonprofit services are not universally or broadly available to everyone because where one lives matters, and access to nonprofit organizations is more limited in suburban and rural communities. Focusing on immigrants in particular, the United States is home to over 43 million immigrants; over half lack U.S. citizenship. Relative to other disadvantaged groups, immigrants often face additional obstacles to accessing social and human services due to language barriers or service restrictions based on citizenship. This project studies the extent of inequalities in nonprofit immigrant services in health care, legal assistance, and refugee resettlement. The project investigates the reasons behind nonprofit service inequalities across place, type of immigrant community, and type of service, comparing the influence of demand, supply, and political factors. Beyond advancing knowledge about the contours of the nonprofit sector, the project will produce a publicly accessible database and web-based map of non-profit organizations and demographic data in 80 counties in the U.S. Southwest. These data will help philanthropists, political leaders, and public officials efficiently and equitably direct funding and programs to fill service gaps, connecting those who need services to nonprofit organizations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Immigrants are often in need of social and human services, but may lack ready access to non-profit organizations that provide such assistance.  This project will study services at the organizational level, mapping service provision in: (1) health care by using the federally funded health clinics dataset on the Health Resources and Services Administration Data Warehouse from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; (2) immigration legal assistance using the Immigration Advocates Network National Immigration Legal Services Directory, the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. (CLINIC), and the United States Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review, and (3) refugee resettlement services drawing from the Office of Refugee Resettlementâ€™s State Programs Directory. The project will cover 80 counties in the U.S. Southwest, including all of Arizona and Nevada and 49 counties in north and central California and will identify specific types of services, language provision, fee structures, etc. Underlying demographic data to test demand theories of nonprofit service provision will come from the American Community Survey (ACS 2014-18) to capture recent immigration, citizenship, foreign-born population, foreign-born without health insurance, individuals with limited English proficiency per language group, and immigrants living under the poverty line. To test supply theories, the project will draw on ACS data, information on county budgets, and proximity to law schools. Political variables will include data on partisanship, voting patterns, the party affiliation of elected officials, and past histories of immigrant rights mobilization. The analysis will build upon the two-step floating catchment area method to develop a service mismatch index that balances supply and demand. Findings from the project will inform sociological theories of organizations, immigration, race and the role of politics in service provision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>OUR GOALS</strong>: Social and human services in the United States are regularly provided by nonprofit organizations through a public-private partnership model. These nonprofit services are, unfortunately, not universally or broadly available. Previous research shows geographic inequities in nonprofit services in rural areas and suburbs, especially as low-income residents increasingly move into suburban communities. However, we know little about nonprofit service provision to immigrant communities. This project asks: (1) how does the presence of community-based organizations map onto immigrants? particular needs, for example, their needs for services in specific languages or for particular health or legal service? (2) How well do nonprofit services cover different geographical areas? This project investigated inequities in the nonprofit sector, focusing on services and vulnerabilities tied to the ongoing demographic diversification of the country via immigration.</p> <p><strong>OUR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH</strong>: We drew on data from the American Community Survey and built an original dataset of community-based organizations to cover population demographics and nonprofit organizations in all 90 counties in California, Arizona and Nevada. This area encompasses more than 10,000 census tracts with a total population of 49 million. We identified more than 1,500 nonprofit services?1,246 health clinics and 312 legal clinics?that were located in 50 of 58 counties in California, 14 of 15 counties in Arizona, and 7 of 17 counties in Nevada. (The remaining counties had no organization meeting our study criteria.)</p> <p>We also created a new index to measure, quantitatively, how well the nearby supply of immigrant-serving health and legal clinics matches the level of local demand, assessed at the level of census tracts. We concentrated on two groups with sociodemographic vulnerability: the foreign-born population without health insurance (approximately 2 million in the study area) and the noncitizen population, who might need immigration legal services (approximately 6 million). The resulting Service Accessibility Index (SAI) incorporates several novel elements, including actual driving time to access services, information on core services offered by clinics, and opening hours.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH FINDINGS</strong>: We found widespread spatial inequality in immigrants? ability to access health and legal services across our study area: where an immigrant lives is a substantial determinant of how many services are easily accessible to them, relative to the size of the local immigrant community. This is not a simple story of big cities or historic gateways providing more services. More specifically, we found that:</p> <ul> <li>mid-size cities often offer the      best access to services, especially in health services;</li> <li>rural areas and their residents      consistently lack services compared to metropolitan areas;</li> <li>suburbs vary in their ability      or efforts to serve immigrants: some suburbs have developed their own      infrastructure; some benefit from (or free-ride on) the nonprofit services      in a proximate central city; and other suburbs are geographically distant      from services, based on travel times, leaving immigrant residents of these      suburbs and bedroom communities with limited services;</li> <li>legal services for immigrants      appear present mostly in medium to large population centers; they are      especially scarce in rural areas and relatively more prevalent close to      state capitols and the US-Mexico border;</li> <li>health services?specifically,      the Federally Qualified Health Clinics in our data set?are more numerous      and penetrate more frequently into rural areas than legal services, and      have good coverage in small cities; as federal funding for such clinics      specifically aims to bring health care to underserved geographic areas,      this is cautious evidence of some mission success.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><strong>ADDITIONAL IMPACT</strong>: Beyond the scientific and real-world importance of our research, this project also provided training to nine graduate and 36 undergraduate students. These students, many from backgrounds historically under-represented in academic research, participated through course credit, paid employment, or other support.</p> <p>We have also worked to provide additional public goods from this project. We developed a free<a href="https://bimi.berkeley.edu/research/mapping-spatial-inequality">&nbsp;mapping tool</a>&nbsp;(https://bimi.berkeley.edu/research/mapping-spatial-inequality) to allow stakeholders and members of the general public to visualize and locate immigrant services across California, Nevada and Arizona. This tool provides information for immigrants or those who are assisting immigrants to find health care and immigrant legal assistance, including information on clinic location, opening hours, services, languages served, and contact information. The COVID pandemic showed how vital it is to have timely, accurate information on services, especially for vulnerable and low-income residents.</p> <p><strong>TO LEARN MORE</strong>: Results and information from this project have been published in an open-access scientific publication available to the public (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231157683">https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231157683</a>) and in 11 policy briefs and research reports, also freely available on the web (<a href="https://bimi.berkeley.edu/policy-briefs">https://bimi.berkeley.edu/policy-briefs</a>).
