<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Advanced manufacturing is on the cusp of a Fourth Industrial revolution, captured by the term Industry 4.0 or Smart Manufacturing. However, challenges abound in realizing the smart manufacturing paradigm. Rapidly reconfigurable production systems envisaged in smart manufacturing are inherently tied to acquisition of large amounts of continuous streaming data from machines and automated robots on the shop floor, as well as from entities dispersed in the supply-logistics chain, using heterogeneous sensors. The data has to be transmitted over wireless channels with tight latency and security guarantees, and coupled with real-time analysis to allow precise trouble-shooting, coordination, and monitoring. The inescapable conclusion is that to enable smart manufacturing, a tight integration – and, in fact, cross-layer optimization – of manufacturing technologies, robotics and control, networking protocols such as 5G, and machine learning paradigms such as inference on the edge is needed. Achieving this vision is the goal of the institute envisaged in this planning grant.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Realizing an effective institute will require experts in advanced manufacturing, AI, sensing, computation, and sensing, as well as collaboration with industry and federal research labs. The major activities in this planning grant aim at developing such a team through a range of activities. The intellectual bulwark of the institute is the enabling of smart manufacturing through a tight integration and cross-layer optimization of manufacturing technologies, networking protocols such as 5G, robotics and control, and machine learning paradigms such as inference on the edge. This integration will also generate and revitalize new research areas that encompass fundamental materials science to large-scale supply networking and cybersecurity to AI-enabled collaborative robotics and human-robot interaction and beyond. The activities also include new curriculum development both at the participating universities and community colleges, as well as plans for outreach through local governments and high schools, for developing the workforce for such a paradigm and broadening participation into AI-related technology among society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

This realization led to the development of an NSF ERC proposal.   The activities carried out as part of this grant had significant intellectual merit on their own. Some of the highlights are as follows.   1. We developed a new framework named dynamic certification for autonomous systems. Dynamic certification refers to the iterative revision of permissible &#10216;use, context&#10217; pairs for a system&mdash;rather than prespecified tests that a system must pass to be certified. Dynamic certification offers the ability to "learn while certifying". This comprehensive, exploratory testing shaped by the proposed deployment can enable iterative selection of appropriate contexts of use. We developed a 3D-printing hexacopter to demonstrate this framework.  2. We also developed a learning based algorithm for discrete massive resource scheduling in massive MIMO and demonstrated its effectiveness in performing very close to the optimal proportionally fair allocation and it superiority compared to existing sub-optimal techniques. Deep learning including deep unrolling methods were shown to achieve close to ML performance with much less complexity compared to ML.

Similarly, we studied the problem of data-driven attack detection for unknown LTI systems using only input-output behavioral data (in contrast with model-based detectors that use errors from an output predictor to detect attacks).   5. We developed and applied novel AI/ML-driven algorithms for detection of flaws in metal 3D printing processes. These algorithms leverage data from multiple in-situ sensors, ranging from 2D imaging and 1D signals, and were capable of detecting flaw formation with accuracy exceeding 95%.   As part of the development of Human Resources, the project provided inter-disciplinary training to multiple post-doctoral scholars, and graduate and undergraduate students.
