<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this (Small Business Innovation Research) SBIR Phase I project includes enabling widespread affordable satellite communication.   Today there are approximately 2,000 satellites in orbit and there are not enough dishes on earth to communicate with all of them. The number of satellites is anticipated to grow to 16,000 in the next few years. Current manufacturing processes are too slow and expensive to meet this rapid growth. Dishes for satellite communication are made of metal sheets that must be curved into a bowl shape. In the past, that shaping process has been done by flexing, stamping, or composite processes that are expensive. Dish designers have been limited to the few curved shapes that are mass produced. This project will develop a commercial fabrication process to quickly shape customized curved panels for satellite communication antennas.This project will develop a fast, flexible process to customize new shapes enabling higher data rates to expand access. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will combine induction heating and adjustable mold technologies to shape flat metal sheets into precise compound curved panels.  An induction coil uses high frequency and high power electric currents to create a strong magnetic field. This magnetic field induces eddy currents in the workpiece, heating it and enabling it to be pressed into an adaptable mold. The reconfigurable mold can quickly change its shape to form different sections of a parabola or other freeform shape. Using an adjustable mold saves the cost of machining a high precision mold for each unique reflector segment. The adjustable mold also allows for easy correction of springback, mold wear, and other errors to achieve higher shape accuracy than other mass production processes. The low tooling cost allows this technology to economically produce any batch size. The project will model and test induction heating and forming processes, ultimately designing a workstation to produce curved panels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Paramium Technologies is developing an agile fabrication process to create freeform curved metal panels. Several industries, including satellite communications, need precision curved metal panels. Historically, these have been made using high-volume processes such as stamping or time intensive custom techniques like CNC profile milling. As the methods for creating custom shapes are slow and expensive, radio antenna designers have been forced to constrain their designs around a limited selection of standard dish shapes. This restriction has prohibited innovation and advancements such as numerical optimization, off-axis antennas, and shaped reflectors that would increase antenna gain and allow higher data speeds. The satellite communication industry needs a new method of dish reflector fabrication that can quickly form custom curves without expensive tooling.&nbsp;</p> <p>Figure 1 compares different ways of making radio dish panels. The vertical axis shows how many hours each method takes to form a 1 meter squared panel. The horizontal axis shows the shape error achieved by each method. Ideally a process would take few hours and have low shape error. Custom manufacturing methods such as machining can achieve low error but are slow. Mass production processes like stamping and spinning are faster but have high shape error. Paramium?s thermoforming technology that was developed during the SBIR Phase I has the ideal combination of speed and accuracy. Most processes require a mold or other tooling that is specific to the panel shape. Paramium?s thermoforming technology does not require new tooling to form a new shape.</p> <p>Paramium uses a process to form curved metal panels. First a flat metal sheet is placed on a curved mold. Then the sheet is heated and pressed into the mold. The sheet then cools and holds its curved shape. During Phase I of an SBIR funded project, Paramium developed a computer&#8209;controlled mold that can change its shape. Now, the desired shape can be entered into the computer; the computer will then adjust the shape of the mold, and the panel can be formed on the mold to take on the desired shape. This means that a single mold can form countless panel shapes. No custom tooling is required to form a new shape. This greatly reduces the cost and lead time of producing custom orders for curved metal panels.&nbsp;</p> <p>As part of Phase I, Paramium also designed an induction workstation to heat the metal panels during forming. Traditional hot stamping processes use large furnaces to heat the metal to be shaped. Paramium?s patent pending process uses an induction coil to heat the metal sheet. Induction heating is much faster than using a furnace. In induction heating, magnetic fields create heat inside the panel itself. There is no need to heat the air or oven walls, so the process is more energy efficient. Figure 2 shows a schematic of the planned thermoforming system.</p> <p>Also, as part of the SBIR Phase I, Paramium designed and fabricated a curved metal panel. Finite element analysis showed that the panel design had low deformation due to gravity and high wind.</p> <p>Paramium measured the shape of the panel with and without the wind loading. The typical wind speed used for the test was 10 m/s. The finite element simulation matched the physical measurement as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.</p> <p>These test results show that the Paramium panel design that uses a thermoformed reflector is sufficiently stiff for use in outdoor V-band radio communication antennas.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/17/2022<br>      Modified by: Roslyn&nbsp;Norman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809253652_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809253652_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809253652_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fabrication time vs. achievable accuracy of various panel manufacturing technologies.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Paramium Technologies LLC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Roslyn&nbsp;Norman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809397504_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809397504_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809397504_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A schematic of Paramium�s Induction Thermoforming system.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Paramium Technologies LLC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Roslyn&nbsp;Norman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809502033_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809502033_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809502033_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A curved test panel fabricated by Paramium during the Phase I SBIR project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Paramium Technologies LLC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Roslyn&nbsp;Norman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809658939_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809658939_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035837/2035837_10712487_1652809658939_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Finite element analysis of how the panel deforms in 10 m/s wind.
