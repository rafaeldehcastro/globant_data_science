<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[In response to the dangerous spread of COVID-19, organizations, including institutions of higher learning, are requiring social distancing, in lieu of in-person gatherings, for an extended period. As one tool in response to pandemics, the CDC has recommended remote work for social distancing. Previous research has shown that it is not enough to insert technology into a situation. People and organizations need technologies designed to fit or be adapted to actual work practices. Resilient organizations must dynamically adapt. This research project will develop evidence about how organizations and diverse people are transformed by transitioning to remote work. It will develop vital guidance for large organizations—which employ and/or serve tens of thousands of stakeholders—about how to prepare for, enact, adjust to, and coordinate remote work. The guidance will be used to quickly inform and educate diverse organizations, stakeholder groups, and citizens about best practices for working together to meet the practical, social, and emotional needs of work communities during a transition to remote working in response to an unfolding crisis. The research team will promote broad public engagement with this guidance through university, social media, and news communications channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is centered on a 1-year qualitative research study at the University of Washington (UW), in Seattle. Seattle was the first US COVID-19 epicenter. UW was the first university to switch to remote learning and work. Data collection will include interviews, observations, targeted archival research, and surveys. The study will involve individuals, groups, networks, and departments, in order to get multi-level and multi-scale perspectives on a full range of activities that effectively support resilient organizations and work communities. Qualitative data analysis, including iterative coding and memoing, will be used to discover and then elaborate on recurring themes.  Underlying the investigation is an understanding that conceptions of organizational resilience are implicitly about cooperative work. The analysis will apply computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) conceptual tools—such as the types of articulation work and how they can amplify organizational resilience—in a novel way. This is expected to yield empirical contributions about the coordination of remote work at different scales, under intense time pressure. It is also expected to create theoretical knowledge on how complex organizations coordinate and support remote work in relation to the social and practical realities of an evolving crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Our research advances knowledge about the dynamics of coordinative and organizational adaptability during the onset of a pandemic crisis. Solving complex problems requires people to collaborate and make sense of their own situations, as well as those of the people, organizations, materials, and environments that surround them. Change is often initiated by events such as a pandemic crisis or by economic pressures such as inflation. Change is also caused purposely by people who are motivated to innovate to solve specific problems. Whatever the cause, addressing or initiating change frequently requires coordination and collaboration. Our research may be considered foundational for the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW).   As more and more work is undertaken with and through socio-technical ecologies of groups, organizations, algorithms, applications, and IT platforms, we need better qualitative and quantitative models for understanding iterative collaborative change.  Our research used qualitative interview methods and qualitative survey methods to study and lay foundations for new models of complex group, intergroup, and inter-organizational sensemaking. Sensemaking includes experiential learning, the articulation of values and preferences, and also the adaptation and creation of best practices. This research builds foundations for both conceptual and methodological advancement for interaction design for unstable, innovative, or highly emergent situations. Our research analyzed how custodial staff, non-academic staff, IT workers, teaching faculty, ladder faculty, chairs and deans experienced work challenges. Individuals and groups described differing environmental and social situations. We detail themes including: shifting collaborative practices, usage of technology, access to materials and places, stresses and opportunities when working from home, interfacing with regulatory landscapes (and interpretations of the same), and differences in ability to to change practices and ways of working based on proximity to decision makers.    Our research also demonstrated commonalities in how people, from custodial workers to IT workers to department chairs, in very different situations worked to act autonomously and in socially and organizationally acceptable ways.    We have also collected a corpus of qualitative survey data to begin to understand how prevalent were the themes identified in our interview study across a large, complex organization such as a large research university.   Finally, we have produced a prototype that is currently under development of a packet of worksheets to be used as part of a group activity for people who collaborated during the pandemic. The packet provides a structured way for groups to reflect upon and learn from their experiences working together during the pandemic.
