<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore applications of a device to predict cellular movement and behaviors in a laboratory. One application is simple and rapid assessment of the aggressive state of cancer in a clinical setting to inform treatment decisions.  This could also be used in research to study cells in order to design new treatments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of wicking fibers for use in separating cells by physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. The fibers are currently used in non-biomedical application, e.g., they may be found in athletic apparel and facial tissue. These fibers are designed with certain features such as the ability to move liquids away from the body. It also has been found that the ability of the fibers to move liquid is an advantage in biomedical applications, both in understanding cell behaviors and in helping assess the current state of a disease. For instance, if fibers are placed vertically in a liquid containing normal and cancerous cells, the tumor cells will move quickly up the fibers, while the normal cells will remain at the bottom. More aggressive cancer cells travel up the fibers more rapidly than less aggressive cells. This rapid differentiation allows us to better understand why cells behave in certain ways and to harness that information to create improved biomedical solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our team spoke with close to two hundred people (veterinarians, pet owners, and diagnostic representatives for large companies) to assess the needs in the veterinary market and whether our cancer predictive technology might be part of a solution. Our interviews led us to narrow our focus from all cancers to canine lymphoma.&nbsp;We learned that current diagnostic practice for this disease involves many specialized tests that often require a referral to a specialty hospital or depend on an expert to interpret the results. Pet owners who do not live close to a specialty hospital are required to travel hours or even out of state to access the nearest facility. Other limitations include the high cost of multiple diagnostic tests. The average owner spends hundreds to thousands of dollars on diagnostics alone. Most of these tests require a cell or tissue sample to be sent to a diagnostic lab, which causes a delay in receiving a confirmed diagnosis and thus delays further treatment. Many owners indicated they want a diagnosis as well as the ability to initiate treatment during an initial visit but are resistant to returning at a later date, for financial and emotional reasons. <strong>Technical Merit:</strong>&nbsp;We learned what qualities an in-house diagnostic device should have in order to be the most beneficial to both the client and the veterinary staff members. Most importantly, we learned that for rural clinics as well as clinics servicing large animal or exotic animal populations, the specific need did not exist; however, we noted recognized needs for a one-trip diagnosis of other diseases pertinent to these populations and this technology. Using what we learned, we tweaked our technology to write the requirements/specifications for a product that would require minimal training to use, provide quick results, have a long shelf-life, and be cost effective for a suburban clinic and the client.&nbsp;We made and tested several prototypes to explore this product space (Fig 1). We are now working through significant scientific challenges that need further work in order to produce a clinically relevant prototype with the listed specifications that would meet these needs. Sample size and form, for example, is especially challenging. We also considered our technology in the context of dovetailing with the existing (and minimally invasive) way of clinically procuring patient cells (Fig 2). We identified a need that, if solved, would solve a specific problem and provide extensions into bigger problems. After we identified our customers, we surveyed this group plus practitioners further to re-design/refine our prototype. <strong>Broader Impact</strong>: This project touched many students beyond the entrepreneurial lead. One important impact is student innovation training ? we used the opportunity to engage undergraduate and graduate students working in our research lab in experiential entrepreneurship training. The students learned how to listen, to identify issues, and to adapt technical solution and explored entrepreneurship (including interviewing internationally recognized inventors). This I-Corps project was presented in different forms and in different venues (pitch competitions, scientific presentations and publications, student theses), with the goal of inspiring others to adopt the approaches and to understand the problem and potentially further the solution to this problem. It also gave our students entrepreneurial communication skills. Overall, we determined that time is of the essence when diagnosing canine cancers and a rapid, affordable screen is of high interest in the suburban veterinary market. This test could save the pet owners thousands on diagnostics, increase profit for small clinics, reduce stress on the patients and pet owners, and improve overall patient care.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/07/2023<br>      Modified by: Karen&nbsp;J&nbsp;Burg</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2041689/2041689_10705873_1678197167984_Fig1_Diagnostic--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2041689/2041689_10705873_1678197167984_Fig1_Diagnostic--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 1.
