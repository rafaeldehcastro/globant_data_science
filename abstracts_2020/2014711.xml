<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is to develop an accessible, rapid, low-cost method to discover and create new high-performance alloys; these alloys could potentially be tailored to specific applications by additive manufacturing.  Currently, alloy development and part manufacturing often utilize a "one-size-fits-all" approach allowing for limited alloy customization.  In most cases, where new materials are created to increase performance, costs can be prohibitive.  Metal additive manufacturing disrupts such conventions, creating opportunities for manufacturing low-volume, niche parts, but still material options remain limited. A new approach could enable a suite of specialized high-performance alloys that directly scales to functional parts, for use by companies of all sizes. This proposal aims to develop the necessary tools and implement this approach to create a new copper-based alloy targeting the injection molding industry to significantly reduce part production times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will develop a novel sample evaluation method to discover and create new metal alloys for laser-based additive manufacturing processes.  The effort will utilize low-cost, rapid testing techniques to evaluate alloy chemistries on a laboratory scale so that the processing-structure-properties relationships can be determined for direct scale up in an additive manufacturing framework.  The chemistry selection will utilize thermodynamic modeling and simulation, low-cost test coupon generation, and a rapid experimental procedure to simulate the thermal history experienced in laser powder bed fusion, allowing for both reduced experimentation timelines and direct feedback into process models for validation and improving accuracy.  The method will be validated by creating a novel copper-based alloy with improved strength and thermal conductivity over the current state-of-the-art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this NSF Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project, we validated a novel high-throughput and scalable alloy development method for melt-based AM.   The approach can determine an alloy?s suitability for melt-based AM while simultaneously developing full processing parameters, all prior to acquisition of a custom atomized powder in a matter of days instead of &gt; 6 months.  This accelerated approach will enable the rapid advancement of high-performance alloys by bridging the gap between advanced computational methods and powder atomization-based validation.     The effort targeted validation through development of a novel high conductivity-high strength copper-based alloy. A range of alloy compositions were developed for a pre-L-PBF high-throughput screening process to probe, assess, and validate an alloy?s thermo-mechanical behavior under high heating and cooling rates.  The stability of each system was determined by minimizing the grain boundary (GB) surface energy as a function of temperature, indicative of negligible driving force for curvature-driven grain growth. To derive a complete L-PBF parameter set and the optimum machine ?tool path,? additional variables had to be adjusted, including beam focus, vector length, number of vectors, and vector overlap.   The key innovation was that the thermal behavior of each new alloy composition can be directly probed prior to expensive and time-consuming powder atomization.      Ultimately, first-build success of several complex test artifacts were printed with a novel Cu-Nb-Y-Ag alloy composition and build parameters were developed prior to powder acquisition.  To our knowledge this was the first time a novel alloy had been printed without powder-based parameter development and zero ?cubes? sample specimen.     While our initial Phase I goals were met with success, we exposed a general lack of standardization and difficulty in accessing all AM print parameters to develop a precise tool path with spatial and temporal sensitivity in the test artifacts.  Exacerbating this discovery was that these limitations vary by machine platforms and operating codes.  In this context, we realized that a disruptive seismic shift in the emergence of AM can only occur after significant maturation of this technology, machine tool paths must evolve to be machine agnostic, and access to all build parameter sets is universal.      On a broader scale, this Phase I project has evolved to include the development of methods to enable universal quality control in L-PBF AM.  The true potential for AM is not to replace all other manufacturing methods but to seamlessly integrate into the engineers manufacturing toolbox.  While at glance this is simple, this has not been achieved due to the lack of transparency in processing control.  By defining parameters exclusively in terms of energy and time a universal and machine agnostic approach can be scaled.  When the innovations validated herein are fully commercialized, the role of researchers in AM will shift from process development to process optimization, alloy development, and design optimization unleashing the true potential of L-PBF that will impact society through the widespread availability of higher performance parts.
