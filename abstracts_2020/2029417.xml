<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Bellarmine University, an independent, Catholic, liberal arts institution. Over its five-year duration, this project will award four-year scholarships to two cohorts of eleven students pursuing undergraduate degrees in computer science, computer engineering, mathematics, or data science. This project has an intentional focus on career preparation and will engage Scholars in four Career Pathway Pillars: (1) an augmented learning community; (2) enhanced faculty, peer, and alumni mentoring; (3) a new shared curriculum experience; and (4) a dedicated career development program.  Scholars will have many opportunities to strengthen their identities as scientists and future STEM professionals while they explore STEM careers, interact with local partner organizations in industry and government, and job-shadow current STEM professionals.  The project will study the effectiveness of undergraduate research and internships as strategies to improve STEM student outcomes.  Results of the study will provide insights into whether internships can provide similar positive benefits as those that are well-documented for undergraduate research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Increasing the number of graduates will help to address significant local industry needs in the rapidly changing STEM workforce and, given the composition of the University’s student body, is likely to contribute to STEM workforce diversity. The project will build on the foundation of existing student learning communities and the well-documented effectiveness of learning communities in nurturing academic and personal success. The design of the project is rooted in theoretical perspectives that emphasize the importance of community and sense of belonging, mentorship, strong academic and social connections, and expanded access to resources that support student success. The project will conduct systematic research comparing the value of experiential learning for STEM majors in terms of breadth and depth of each experiential learning type. The project will address the following questions: 1) To what extent will student outcomes be related to the characteristics of the experiential learning, including supervisor/mentor behaviors?  and 2) Are outcomes impacted by factors such as student cohort or student demographics such as income or first-generation status? An external evaluator will conduct formative and summative assessments of the project’s progress towards goals, supported by a local Tech/Analytics Employer Advisory Board.  The project’s resources, findings, and outcomes will be shared with industry, government, and higher education communities through presentations to Advisory Board members, participation in regional and national conferences, and publications in peer-reviewed journals. This project is funded by NSF’s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
