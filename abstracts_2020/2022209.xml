<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This proposal supports student travel for 18 students to attend the 2020 Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS), to be held in Montreal, Canada from July 14-18, 2020. PETS is a leading venue for quick and wide dissemination of cutting-edge research that address the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks by bringing together anonymity and privacy experts from around the world to discuss recent advances in, and new perspectives on Privacy. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students will have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer researchers in privacy, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2020 PETS conference by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by research output, coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
