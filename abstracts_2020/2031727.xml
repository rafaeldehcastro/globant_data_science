<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new vaccine delivery technology against new emerging pathogens such as that causing COVID-19.  This project will develop a new process that can be rapidly manufactured with high affinity and precision-engineered immune responses. The technology is based on new materials that can be injected to help support the immune system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a novel vaccine delivery technology using flowable hyper-porous and synthetic materials. This new material technology can be easily injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly to deliver vaccine antigens. The material itself acts as a long-lasting antigen delivery vehicle, increasing antibody production and polarizing the immune system to maximize protective immunity against the delivered antigens. This project specifically focuses on development of this novel material to create multifactor immunity against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to protect against COVID-19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through this Phase I SBIR project, we were able to demonstrate how our Microporous Annealed Particle (MAP) technology can be used as a vaccine scaffold to combat new emerging pathogens such as COVID-19.

During this project, we have developed a new multifunctional and versatile vaccine platform, VaxMAP, with unique characteristics that no other vaccines combined before: i) VaxMAP serves as an adjuvant to boost the immune system, ii) as well as a depot for a slow and sustained release of the loaded antigen to induce a robust and prolonged immunity, iii) VaxMAP is tunable to induce a polarized immune response that is more specific to the targeted pathogen and iv) multiple antigens can be loaded in a single formulation for a more effective response. During this project, we showed that VaxMAP outperformed a commonly used adjuvant with a stronger and prolonged humoral response and a good safety profile (as demonstrated in multiple pre-clinical studies per ISO 10993, outside the scope of this project).
