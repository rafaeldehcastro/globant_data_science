<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This workshop proposal includes attendee travel support for approximately 30-40 academic participants to attend the Workshop on Next-G Mobile Security planned to be held in Alexandria, Virginia in late 2020 or early 2021 timeframe. This workshop plans to discuss and generate a research agenda that produces new knowledge on securing the next generation of mobile networking through bringing together 40-50 researchers with diverse backgrounds in mobile, wireless and security and privacy. The two-day event features multiple keynotes and a multi-track agenda focusing on four main topic areas: physical-layer security, infrastructure security, validation and verification for securing the Next-G mobile platforms, and data privacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is extremely timely with interest from government, academic, and industry â€“ both those creating and securing the networks as well as the many vertical segments using the future networks for transportation, medical applications, and much more. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From 2020 to 2023, this project aimed to facilitate intellectual discussions on improving the security and functionality of next-generation (NextG) networks, featuring a series of workshops and academic publications. The project began with the NSF Workshop in 2020, which aimed to address security challenges in NextG networks. This workshop brought together experts from diverse backgrounds to discuss and develop strategies for securing NextG technologies.    In June 2021, the project facilitated a workshop for the RINGS program, facilitating teaming activities for researchers interested in contributing to NextG security. The workshop's proceedings were shared on YouTube, making the information accessible to a broader audience.   A significant event in 2023 was a workshop in Orlando, FL, focusing on measurements for self-driving networks. This workshop explored the possibilities of automating and self-regulating network systems using artificial intelligence and machine learning, aiming for increased efficiency and security.   The project also addressed the issue of the digital divide, exploring how NextG networks could help provide more equitable internet access to diverse populations, aiming to contribute to social equity in the digital realm.    Alongside these workshops, the project contributed to academic literature, including a notable publication in IEEE Security &amp; Privacy titled "Challenges and Opportunities for Beyond-5G Wireless Security." This paper shared insights from the first workshop, reaching an audience beyond those who attended.   Regarding intellectual contributions, the project added to the existing knowledge of NextG network security and operations. The workshops and publications helped deepen the general understanding of these technologies in academic and practical contexts.   The project's findings have practical applications in improving the safety, reliability, and inclusivity of next-generation networking technologies. Discussions about bridging the digital divide highlight the project's aim to use technology for societal benefits.   Overall, over its three-year course, the project served as a platform for discussions on NextG security. It combined theoretical research with practical application, addressing challenges in network security and accessibility. The project's workshops, publications, and discussions have contributed to the academic field and laid the groundwork for advancements in secure digital connectivity.
