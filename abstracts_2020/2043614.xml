<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project examines how networks of collaborative research are challenging the way we study about soils. Contemporary understanding of soil focus on how it is a one of the most biodiverse and critical ecosystems on the planet. This project will trace how scientific practices of studying soil microbes are driving terrestrial cycles of carbon, water, phosphorous, and nitrogen. It will follow scientists as they investigate soil microbial activity in relation to climate conditions, plant pathogens, and medicinal resources for humans. The project will document how novel research techniques are helping scientists design soil microbial processes to respond to changing climate conditions and soil issues.  The project will provide insight for natural scientists, social scientists, and policymakers to better understand how specific soil science practices inform current priorities and challenges of soil health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central focus of this research project is the collaborative networks of soil scientists and biotech engineers. The project uses ethnographic strategies to trace the social and technical infrastructure of soil microbiology research through which scientists assemble their understanding of soils as living systems. Its analysis draws on qualitative data from interviews with scientists and participant observation in soil research settings. While human-soil interactions are often examined in agricultural contexts, this project is among the first to examine how scientists construct new meanings and materialities of soils in their research practices. Scientific explorations of soil microbiomes are contributing to mapping new frontiers of ecological knowledge. This project will study how political and cultural transformations can support new possibilities for human adaptation and survival on a rapidly changing planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Drawing on data from ethnographic fieldwork, this study examined the cultural dimensions of soil microbiome science in the Netherlands. The researcher collected approximately 50 interviews with scientists and conducted participant observation at laboratories, field experiments, greenhouses, technology companies, and data centers. The project’s findings account for how scientists articulate different meanings and values of soil biodiversity through their practices of knowledge production.  Historically referred to as the "Garden of Europe'', the Netherlands is a regional leader in the green life science industry. The Dutch government’s plan to transition to a circular bio-economy by 2050 has led to increased funding for scientific research on soil microbiomes. Despite soils being the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, only about 1% of all soil microorganisms have been identified and described. Given their profound role in global biogeochemical processes, soil microbiota are imagined as a "storehouse" of genetic information that could lead to innovations in agricultural biotechnology, climate adaptation, and biodiversity conservation.  Often funded by public-private partnerships, scientists conducted laboratory and field experiments to understand the structure, function, and evolution of soil microbiomes. Ever-evolving molecular techniques enabled scientists to identify and code genes for useful enzymes and metabolites, linking underground species to vital ecosystem functions related to nutrient cycling, carbon dynamics, and plant disease suppression. Many scientists looked to patent novel microbial inoculants that could replace agrochemical fertilizers and pesticides. Others hoped that knowledge of microbial ecologies would inform new plant breeding and engineering strategies for sustainable agriculture.
