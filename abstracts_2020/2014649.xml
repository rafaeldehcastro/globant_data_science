<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a reliable tool for law enforcement for the detection of cannabis-related driving impairment. Impaired operation of equipment costs the nation hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Our detection tool is a software application designed to be presented on a mobile tablet device. It will utilize a combination of neurocognitive, behavioral, and physiological indicators of cannabis intoxication to make an informed determination of impairment. This detection tool may be used as a roadside device by law enforcement, as a screening tool by employers of transit companies, or by an individual user. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a portable mobile device and software to perform a roadside cannabis detection test. The software will perform a rapid sequence of neuropsychological tests.  Combined with an infrared camera to track eye movement and pupillary reflex during driver evaluation, this system can potentially detect driving impairment due to tetrahydrocannabinol. A machine learning algorithm will be used to both assess physical and neurological test results and to present a progressive testing architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OVERVIEW: As more states legalize retail markets and the frequency of cannabis use escalates, there is an eminent need to provide a detection device to law enforcement in order to protect public safety. This grant was funded to create a transformative technology that is a reliable and valid technique to detect cannabis-related driving impairment.  Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in cannabis produces specific effects on cognitive processes and behavior, and these are discernable from alcohol and other drugs. Our detection tool is a rapid sequence of neuropsychological tests presented on a mobile tablet computer, and it assesses psychomotor and neurocognitive impairments created by THC.  Our Rapid Neuropsychological Test Battery can be performed at roadside within a matter of minutes and has been designed to complement the necessary work performed by officers specially trained for drug-related impairment (Drug-Recognition Experts) to help them address the growing problem on our highways resulting from increased cannabis use.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project was designed to bring 45 years of psychopharmacological laboratory research on the effects of THC to the forefront of roadside motor-vehicle-operator testing.  BROADER IMPACT: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has explicitly requested a device to detect cognitive and behavioral impairments related to cannabis use, and we are answering their call to address this unmet and urgent need. The goals of Phase 1 were to fully develop the software functionality of our detection tool, and we believe we have met those objectives.
