<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The goals of this project are to use the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, a global undergraduate research activity at the interface of biological sciences and synthetic biology, as a tool to recruit and retain diverse students in STEM and give them meaningful research experiences through participation in the University of Virginia iGEM team. Participation in the iGEM competition enables and broadens undergraduate participation in synthetic biology research at the University of Virginia, enhancing access for women and individuals under-represented in STEM.  The project develops an inter-disciplinary STEM workforce from a diverse cohort of science and engineering students by providing an opportunity for cross-discipline communication and problem solving. The project also supports the bio-economy by introducing students to and creating an opportunity for student-driven entrepreneurship within the field of synthetic biology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Virginia iGEM team has a long and successful of engaging students projects in the field of synthetic biology. The current project concerns the use of synthetic biology for the commercial production of various pharmaceuticals, reagents, and other organic compounds. A major impediment in such commercial productions is the lack of a versatile, reliable, and efficient method to increase the flow of molecules through specific biochemical pathways within a cell.  This problem is addressed in this project with the use of the biosynthesis of resveratrol as an experimental model. Specifically, mathematical modeling combined with existing knowledge of molecular structures is being used to design small artificial compartments within bacteria that serve as a foundry for resveratrol biosynthesis. Once designed, the compartments are assembled in cells, through the regulated expression of synthetic genes, and tested for efficiency, reliability, and versatility. The project builds basic research into a foundational technology to expand the applications of synthetic biology, especially in the area of bio-manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

A diverse cohort of twelve students from multiple STEM fields participated in 2021 and received hands-on training in one or more STEM fields beyond their academic major, which resulted in the a) introduction of students to syntehtic biology, a relatively new STEM field at the interface of the life sciences and engineering, b) technical and technial communication cross-training of students, in a team work-dependent environment,  across STEM fields, resulting in improved labor force training that prepares students to be part of the evolving bio-economy or competitive for advanced educational opportunities in fields emerging at the interface of STEM disciplines, c) opportunity for four women to access research in synthetic biology, and d) introduction of students to the global STEM community, resulting in networking with professional role models and a new awareness that competition for scientific and technological superiority internationally requires continuous innovation and strategic road mapping.  This award enabled technical innovation, wherein student participants designed a platform technology for a safer, greener, and more cost effective alternative to the traditional synthesis of commercially valued organic compounds.   For proof-of-principle, designed was a protein shell, i.e., a molecular crucible,  to contain within bacteria the biosynthetic reactions for the synthesis of the potential anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory resveratrol.  In the time period of the award, the protein shell and components within the shell necessary for improving the efficiency of biosynthetic reactions were produced, though without final assembly of the biological device.
