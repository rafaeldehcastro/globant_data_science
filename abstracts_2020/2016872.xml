<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Research and experience support the assertion that having a more diverse and inclusive team of individuals improves outcomes in research and training. By broadening participation for underrepresented groups, we open doors to new ideas and new breakthroughs. This symposium and related workshop for students in the biology of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles, will showcase data- and experience-driven presentations by speakers who will not only discuss the merits of diversity, equity, and inclusion in science, but will provide training on how to implement workable strategies for these initiatives. A strong mentoring program will actively bring and support undergraduate students into the field, which will have long-term benefits for the scientific community at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium and workshop, to be held in conjunction with the annual Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (JMIH) in July 2021, will promote a more inclusive environment for underrepresented groups in the fields of herpetology and ichthyology. Increasing participation in these fields will have dramatic effects across biology. The goal is to increase diversity and equity through three activities: 1) increase the dialog among professional societies regarding the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in science; 2) provide support for undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from URGs, through a network of mentors; and 3) provide an interactive workshop that will enable participants to recognize the role of social identity in the scientific enterprise equip them to better serve mentees from diverse backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
