<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region, and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by supporting planning activities with clear potential to develop novel, leading edge research ideas and approaches to address NNA goals. It integrates aspects of the natural environment, built environment, and social systems, addresses important societal challenges, and engages with local and Indigenous communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groundwater is a key drinking water source in Alaska. However, groundwater in Alaska is commonly contaminated with naturally occurring metals including iron, manganese, and arsenic. When these contaminants are present in drinking water, they pose a serious health threat. Water treatment systems in many rural communities are not always able to remove these contaminants. This situation endangers the well-being of the community, diminishes trust in the treatment system, and reduces use of the treated water. The goal of this project is to address challenges involved with treatment, delivery, and use of drinking water in rural communities, with a special focus on indigenous residents. Benefits to society result from identification of ways to improve water services for communities of indigenous Alaskans that use groundwater contaminated with iron, manganese, and arsenic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contamination of groundwater with naturally occurring iron, manganese, and arsenic poses a significant threat to Alaskans who use it as a source of drinking water. The goal of this project is to address this threat by: i) creating a holistic conceptual model of the factors, interactions, and feedbacks that shape access to safe, reliable, and socially acceptable drinking water in rural Alaska, ii) identifying gaps in our understanding or capacity to solve the problem, and iii) building a team of experts and community members poised to tackle these gaps. To accomplish this goal, project leaders are leveraging existing knowledge about treatment, delivery, and use of contaminated groundwater in indigenous Alaskan communities from a diverse set of experts and stakeholders, including Tribal members. The project is led by three female scientists with backgrounds in natural science, engineering, and anthropology located at a traditional research university (University of Washington) and a Tribal non-profit (Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium). Project results hold the potential to fundamentally advance understanding of the complex system of natural and built environments, as well as social factors that affect safe drinking water access in rural Alaskan communities, and facilitate the generation of novel hypotheses about how this complex system will respond to Arctic climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
