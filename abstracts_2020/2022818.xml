<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will pioneer a novel three-dimensional nanolithography system using light interactions with colloidal nanoparticles. The ability to create a three-dimensional object at the nanoscale has enabled unique material properties and device performances. However, almost all of the existing lithography systems are based on complicated mechanical, electronic, and optical hardware that can be prohibitively expensive. This award supports fundamental research to provide the required knowledge for three-dimensional nanolithography that is based solely on colloid-light interactions instead of current expensive lithography, hence nanolithography with inexpensive hardware. The new process focuses on colloidal nanoparticles, which will serve as elementary building blocks that can manipulate and shape light for nanoscale patterning. This system will enable scalable printing of complex three-dimensional nanostructures for needleless drug delivery, multifunctional materials, and stretchable sensors. The results of this research will find broad application in biomedical, energy, electronic, and aerospace industries that will benefit the U.S. economy and the advance its manufacturing sector. This research is interdisciplinary and will further understandings in nanotechnology, physics, materials science, and engineering. The integrated research and educational goals will greatly increase engineering education in society through direct engagement of K-12 students, teachers, parents, and the local community in nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to overcome the key barriers to existing 3D nanolithography systems, which can have high operating cost, limited patterning resolution, and/or low fabrication throughput. State-of-the-art direct-write approaches, such as electron-beam, focused-ion-beam, two-photon lithography, can achieve fine features and have played critical roles in laboratory device demonstrations. However, these systems require serial patterning and layer-by-layer processes that are time intensive and difficult to scale. This research diverges from the traditional hardware-intensive approaches to lithography, and replaces them with colloidal nanoparticles that are illuminated to generate a wealth of near-field optical nanopatterns. By tailoring the light properties and particle parameters, such interactions will be harnessed as a novel mechanism to pattern complex 3D geometries. This approach combines the cost-effectiveness of "bottom-up" self-assembly, while retaining the user-specified pattern controllability of "top-down" lithography. The research team will perform rigorous modeling of near-field light-particle interactions to investigate the image formation mechanism, develop fabrication processes to control structure geometry and material composition, mitigate process defects and increase yield in a scale-up prototype system, and demonstrate continuous printing of complex 3D nanostructures into novel functional devices.]]></AbstractNarration>

To create 3D geometry beyond polymer materials, this project has also developed and demonstrated multilayer fabrication processes to control structure geometry and material composition. The patterning techniques developed in this research have led to several novel nanostructures with physical properties that cannot be found in traditional macroscale materials. These properties include highly porous material with near-unity refractive index, low density, and high stiffness, transparent conductors that are mechanically stretchable, and dynamic iridescent surface that can change color in real time. The novel colloidal patterning mechanism was harnessed to build a roll-to-roll prototype system that can continuously print 3D periodic nanostructures on flexible substrates with high throughput. This system was coupled with automated inspection protocols to mitigate process defects and increase yield, demonstrating that the light interactions with colloidal particles can be a scalable, high-throughput method for nanopatterning.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/06/2022<br>      Modified by: Chih-Hao&nbsp;Chang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022818/2022818_10406787_1662476408762_NSF_R2R--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022818/2022818_10406787_1662476408762_NSF_R2R--rgov-800width.jpg" title="R2R Prototype System"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022818/2022818_10406787_1662476408762_NSF_R2R--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="R2R Prototype System"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The roll-to-roll prototype system built as a part of this research that can use colloidal particles as near-field �masks� to pattern continuously print 3D nanostructures.</div> <div class="imageCredit">I-Te Chen</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Chih-Hao&nbsp;Chang</div> <div class="imageTitle">R2R Prototype System</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022818/2022818_10406787_1662476498057_NSF_nanolattice--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022818/2022818_10406787_1662476498057_NSF_nanolattice--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Multilayer nano lattices with non-uniform material composition"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022818/2022818_10406787_1662476498057_NSF_nanolattice--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Multilayer nano lattices with non-uniform material composition"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cross-section analysis of non-uniform nanolattice structures.
