<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the development of a fully flexible high-temperature (operating in the 200-400°C range) insulation product for industrial applications (e.g. pipes and other process systems).  The proposed technology offers performance improvements compared to current solutions, such as fiberglass and mineral wool, while reducing costs through lower-cost manufacturing  and easier installation.  High-temperature industrial insulation can achieve significantly greater energy savings versus building insulation, leading to project paybacks as low as 1-2 years.  This will reduce costs and energy loads in energy-intensive industries such as food, paper, chemicals, refining and metals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will utilize nanomaterials to produce a novel composite insulation material that is flexible and delivers high performance above 200°C.  The inorganic materials will raise temperature durability while high-temperature specialty polymers will enable flexibility.  The materials will be processed using high-volume chemical foaming processes (such as extrusion) scalable into mass production using off-the-shelf equipment, addressing cost and throughput issues.  This work addresses a longstanding industry challenge to mass-produce a fully flexible high-temperature insulation material easily installable by a single individual using standard tools and supplies.  A key activity is to reduce pore sizes below the mean free path of air (~100 nm).  This minimizes all three forms of heat transfer - conduction, convection and radiation, the last of which becomes more prominent at high temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Liatris's Phase I NSF work was built around the broader challenge of developing insulation products with higher fire and temperature tolerances that remain cost-competitive and easy-to-install.  The highest performance, lowest cost building insulation is made of flammable organic polymers. The flammability of these compounds plus the high air content in insulation (over 95% porosity) creates a major fire hazard, especially when containing residual petroleum-based blowing agents.  Addressing these shortcomings, while providing easier handling and installation than non-flammable mineral wool (which requires reinforcement and strapping) would have significant implications for both buildings and industrial applications, which collectively account for &gt;70% of US energy use.   Liatris's initial product will be an easy-to-install non-combustible insulation board, sold initially on an OEM / private label basis to a leading global building systems provider for use in exterior insulation systems such as cladding, facades, rain screens, wall panels, etc. for commercial (e.g., hospitality, medical, office, etc.) and multi-family residential buildings.  Non-combustibility is also a key desired specification for high-temperature industrial insulation (200-400 degrees C), an application where substantial energy savings can be rapidly achieved.    The major technical challenge of our Phase I work was to demonstrate lab-scale prototypes of this composite material which have the processing efficiency of an organic polymer as well as the thermal performance and fire resistance of present inorganic high-temperature (HT) insulation, most notably mineral wool.  Our Phase I efforts contained three key technical building blocks: (a) making non-flammable nanopore insulation by embedding finished aerogel within an inorganic binder, (b) Improving insulation performance through in-situ generation of nanopores within an inorganic binder, thus eliminating the high cost of using pre-made aerogels and (c) Integration of nanogel drying with foaming of flexible high-temperature binder.    We demonstrated lab samples with an R-value of 5.5 / inch, higher performance than all mass-produced foam insulation products on the market today, while being comparable in weight to mineral wool (with a clear path for further density / weight reduction).  These samples represent one of the first industrially engineered composite insulation materials which is fully non-flammable.  We also established basic processing conditions for key building blocks such as silica, clay, and cellulose.  Further optimization and scale-up of these materials post Phase I will drive a competitive cost / performance ratio as well as ease of installation and low carbon footprint.
