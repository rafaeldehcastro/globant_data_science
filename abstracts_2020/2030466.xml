<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[An award is made to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) to investigate the molecular mechanism of an essential coronavirus protease reaction in real time.  This project addresses fundamental questions how the SARS coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) proliferates. CoV-2 is the source of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacts public health and national prosperity. The CoV-2 main protease, also called 3CLpro, catalyzes an essential reaction for assembly of CoV-2 infectious particles.  If the 3CLpro is blocked, the virus cannot assemble, and its spread is effectively suppressed. The goal is to characterize the 3CLpro’s catalytic cycle at ambient temperatures with X-ray structures. This research takes advantage of opportunities at X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in Menlo Park, CA. XFELs are the strongest X-ray sources in the world that make it possible to capture molecular reaction intermediates at near atomic resolution within biologically relevant temperatures and time scales. The unique opportunities at XFELs will advance the understanding of 3CLpro catalysis and its function in the proliferation of the virus and contribute to the elimination of the pandemic. This project will involve UWM graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who will be trained in newest data collection and data analysis methods at XFELs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In host cells the SARS-CoV-2’s RNA genome is translated by host ribosomes into a long polypeptide strand that must be cleaved into functional proteins. This is achieved by the CoV-2 3CLpro. If the 3CLpro is inhibited, the newly formed virus particles cannot assemble correctly and become non-infectious. This project structurally characterizes the catalytic cycle of the 3CLpro at XFELs. XFELs are extremely powerful, femtosecond-pulsed X-ray sources, which became available to a wider community a decade ago. At XFELs, crystal structures that are essentially free of radiation damage can be determined at ambient (near physiological) temperatures. Within 3CLpro microcrystals the catalytic cycle will be initiated by diffusion of substrate. Since the crystals are so small, diffusion is not rate-limiting. Microcrystals are mixed with substrate at various time delays before the mixture is injected into the X-ray beam, a method known as ‘mix-and-inject’ serial crystallography (MISC). MISC will be used to follow the 3CLpro enzymatic reaction in real time with X-ray structures of reaction intermediates. The binding of small compounds that inhibit the 3CLpro will be probed at near atomic resolution at relevant temperatures. Results will (i) aid the design and discovery of new inhibitory compounds that affect the function of this essential protease and prevent the formation of infectious viral particles, and (ii) contribute to the development of MISC as an applicable method at XFELs, to be used for the structural characterization of reactions in biologically significant molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is made by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Due to the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic caused almost 7 million deaths worldwide, making it one of the deadliest infectious diseases in history. Several vaccines are available, that have contributed immensely to stop the spread of the virus. Few antiviral compounds are also approved for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in people who are more likely to get very sick. During the time pandemic was prevalent, the vaccine and treatment costs have been free of charge. However recently, the WHO declared an end to COVID-19 pandemic. The government will soon stop supplying the COVID vaccines for free. Still, there are thousands of people who get infected daily and are at risk of severe illness. This calls for a need for an effective and inexpensive treatment and prevention of COVID-19. A prerequisite is to understand the structure and function of vital enzymes to the virus. The replication of the SARS CoV-2 is dependent on the activity of two cysteine proteases, a papain like protease (PLpro), and the 3C like protease (3CLpro). In its functional form the 3CLpro (also known as the main protease, Mpro) is a homo dimer with Cys/His dyad in the catalytic site. The 3CLpro tailor cuts various essential virus proteins out of a long poly peptide translated from virus RNA. These proteins are responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome, and thus, the infectivity of the virus.

Still, ascorbate and other small molecules point to potential sites that can be exploited to identify a binding pattern for more potent effectors. The unit cell and space group plasticity (more than half a dozen of different crystal forms are known) indicates that the structure of the 3CLpro reacts strongly to ligand (and substrate) binding by conformational changes. A room temperature structure was determined with serial crystallography at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Mix and inject experiments with ebselen are not successful since the ebselen concentration in the aqueous solution is too low to generate measurable occupancy in the active sites.
