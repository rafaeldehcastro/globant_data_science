<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Eruptions generated by sunspots --- large concentrations of magnetic field on the visible surface of the Sun --- can have a number of dire impacts on Earth-based technological systems, crippling satellites and power grids, among many other things.  With enough advance notice, the effects of these events can be mitigated, but predicting them is a real challenge.  In current operational practice, this is accomplished by human forecasters examining images of the Sun, classifying each sunspot according to a taxonomy developed in the 1960s, and then using look-up tables of historical probabilities to say whether or not it will erupt in the next 24 hours.  Recently, there has been a burst of work on machine-learning methods to automate this task.  To date, the "features" used in these approaches have been predominately physics-based: the gradient of the magnetic field, for instance, or the sum of its strength over high-flux regions.  The main objective of this 3-year research project is to leverage algorithms based on the fundamental mathematics of shape --- topology and geometry --- to improve the performance of these methods.  The specific plan is to use these powerful techniques to extend the relevant feature set to include characteristics of the magnetic field that are based purely on the geometry and topology of 2D magnetogram images. Although this approach ignores the 3D structure of the full electromagnetic fields, it can enhance the predictive skill of machine learning systems.  Preliminary results show clear topological changes emerging in magnetograms of a 2017 sunspot more than 24 hours before it flared, as well as clear improvements in the accuracy scores of a neural-net based flare prediction method that employs these shape-based features.  Better predictions of solar flares could allow operators of power grids, airlines, communications satellites, and other critical infrastructure systems to mitigate the effects of these potentially destructive events.  The broader impacts of this project also include the development of the STEM workforce through the training of graduate students at the University of Colorado at Boulder, as well as education and outreach, including community lectures, development of large-scale, online courses and public lecture series.  The interdisciplinary nature of the project will deepen the contact between the fields of space weather, applied mathematics, and computer science, bringing researchers, students, and post-docs from both fields into productive new collaborations.  The collaboration with the Space Weather Technology, Research, and Education Center at the University of Colorado offers unique opportunities to factor in real-world forecasting constraints and set the stage for transitioning the results to operational status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time, this 3-year research project would provide systematic quantitative measures of the shape of 2D magnetic structures in the Sunâ€™s photosphere for the purposes of solar flare prediction.  In a sense, this amounts to a mathematical systemization of the venerable McIntosh and Hale classification systems.  This approach differs from current studies in the solar physics community that model the magnetic field-line structure: it uses topology to address the structure of two-dimensional sets.  The analysis is restricted to photospheric magnetic field structures; the goal is to extract a formal characterization of shape that can be leveraged by machine learning to improve flare prediction.  The considered addition of geometry into these methods by the project team is essential if they are to capture the full richness and physical relevance of the structures important in the evolution of a sunspot.  This research project will point the way forward to a more robust set of features for machine-learning-based eruption prediction architectures.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
