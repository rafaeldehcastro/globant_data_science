<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award provides travel support for students, post-docs and young faculty to attend and participate in the Symposium on "Polymer Processing: Nanomanufacturing and Nanofabrication" at the Spring American Chemical Society (ACS) national meeting in Philadelphia, PA, in March 22-26, 2020. The symposium focuses on new research in the field of polymer processing, nanofabrication and nanomanufacturing. The students present through oral and poster sessions their latest research results to the polymer processing, advanced manufacturing and broader engineering communities. Priority is given to student participants who are women or who come from underrepresented minority groups. This approach promotes diverse participation at the conference, in the short term, and in STEM fields, in the long term. This award benefits the nation through the education of a skilled and diverse manufacturing workforce and a workforce better prepared to provide transformative solutions the challenges in their chosen fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This participation support is expected to benefit the students' professional, scientific and technical development. Attendance at the conference gives the students a broader view of the polymer processing, advanced manufacturing and engineering profession and of state-of-the-art research in their fields via access to several technical and professional development talks by leading domestic and international speakers. Students enhance their communication skills through oral and poster presentations, in-depth discussions of their work with peers in their fields. This interactive experience significantly broadens student education, increases their enthusiasm for their research topic, acquaints them with expectations for scientific careers, and exposes them to new approaches for innovative research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
