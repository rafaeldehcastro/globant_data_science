<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Researchers from the Northwest Research Associates Inc. and the University of Puget Sound will explore the pedagogical benefits of using computational guided inquiry (CGI) to integrate products of contemporary polar research into undergraduate courses. In CGI-structured learning, the instructor guides students in hands-on scientific inquiry using computational tools for analysis and visualization of data. The PIs propose to develop twelve, 2-3 week undergraduate teaching modules based on the analysis of polar data. The modules will be tested in a variety of undergraduate classrooms, including those at two- and four-year institutions. Students will gain computational skills working with Python programming and with critical thinking and analysis of polar data sets. The proposed work offers a range of broader impacts, including education of undergraduate students, development of new course materials, advancement of active learning methods, and engagement of undergraduate student researchers in polar and pedagogical research. Benefits to society include increasing climate and computational literacy and the understanding of polar regions and their role in the climate. The educational materials developed as part of this proposal will directly impact a variety of undergraduate courses at a range of institutions, including state universities, liberal arts colleges, and community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is designed to test whether working directly with polar data via CGI can improve undergraduate climate literacy while enhancing learning outcomes in a variety of undergraduate courses. The work builds on proven educational practices: active learning and guided inquiry. Working with CGI-experienced instructors who will teach the modules, undergraduate researchers and an education research specialist, the PIs will refine the modules, guided by a constructivist framework that includes development of a mental model and hypothesis formulation and testing. An external evaluator will develop questions to measure student knowledge gains and deploy pre- and post-module knowledge surveys. Student survey results will be analyzed to assess knowledge gains and attitudinal shifts. Dissemination to the wider educational community will be accomplished through webinars, conferences, and via the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) educational website portal.  This project is funded by the Office of Polar Programs and the Division of Undergraduate Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
