<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[JEDI Alliance: Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in the Geo- and Environmental Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF INCLUDES planning grant is funded by NSF Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES), a comprehensive national initiative to enhance U.S. leadership in discoveries and innovations by focusing on diversity, inclusion, and broadening participation in STEM at scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of our planning grant is to harness the collaborative potential of the GOLD community so that we can understand what each of the five GOLD projects has learned regarding faculty leadership development for justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.  We also want to combine these strategies into a national alliance focused specifically on justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in the geo- and environmental sciences. Given these goals, four overarching questions will guide our inquiry: &lt;br/&gt;1.  How do the successes and challenges of each of the five GOLD projects broadly inform the process of developing leadership for broadening participation? &lt;br/&gt;2.  How can the component pieces from GEO GOLD be woven into a comprehensive model for leadership for broadening participation? How is impact measured across the diverse projects?&lt;br/&gt;3.  How does the GOLD learning community effectively transform itself into a collective impact community? &lt;br/&gt;4.  What form of a backbone organization best serves the goals and aspirations of the JEDI Alliance? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning efforts will lead to the creation of a comprehensive alliance proposal that builds on the groundwork of the five GOLD projects and creates a national alliance to influence a culture of change within the geo- and environmental sciences that promotes justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI).  The shared vision of our five GOLD projects is to develop the capacity of leadership teams within the field to identify and redress organizational practices that impede broadening participation efforts in the GES.  Although we focus on the geosciences, our efforts will be applicable to disciplines in which there is significant fieldwork involved and working in remote research locations. Our planning efforts will also result in identifying a robust backbone organization that will allow us to have true collective impact through coordinated communication, data collection, and collective decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
