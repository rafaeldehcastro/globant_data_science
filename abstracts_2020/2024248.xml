<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project uses funding for a two-year pilot study to explore the paleoclimate information potentially stored in ice cores recovered from a select number of lava tubes from El Malpais National Monument (ELMA) in western New Mexico, a region of great potential for drought research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instrumental climate records indicate that drought patterns in southwestern North America are sensitive to Pacific Decadal Ocean (PDO) variability and to interactions between the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North American Monsoon System (NAMS).  A deeper understanding of the past (pre-instrumental) behavior of these modes could be helpful for improving predictions of future drought and pluvial cycles.  Seasonally-accumulated ice in lava tubes may provide an high-resolution and well-dated record of changing climatic conditions that will test the overarching hypothesis that ENSO and NAMS variability were persistent features over the past millennia in the Southwest and that all major climate periods (e.g., Medieval Warm Period) were part of this pattern of decadal-to-interdecadal variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to: 1) provide proof of concept for the use of stable isotopic composition of ice deposits in lava tubes where carbonates are not available for delta 18-Oxygen analyses; 2) contribute to a growing network of quantitative paleoclimate datasets that would add a critical spatial and temporal perspective to the understanding of aridity patterns in southwestern North America and associated synoptic climate teleconnections; and 3) develop high-resolution, decadal-to-interdecadal scale isotopic records from ice in lava tubes in the Southwest for the past 3,000 years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project may also help address other important science questions such as: 1) How delta 18-Oxygen and deuterium excess of ice indicate changes in the moisture source and air temperature during ice formation? 2) How is hydroclimate variability in the south west U.S. reflected by the stable isotopic composition of ice and which of the large-scale modes of climate variability were operating over the past 3000 years? and 3) Can ice deposits be used to identify spatial patterns of aridity (megadroughts) in the Southwest during late Holocene.  To address these questions, the ice isotopic record will be used in conjunction with radiocarbon dated charcoal recovered from ice and high-resolution tree-ring data available at ELMA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts include support for a graduate student, the potential for developing a new archive of paleoclimate data, and the advancement of the science of drought in the southwestern U.S., an area of concern for current and future water resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Much of the information about past climate and environmental conditions on timescales from decades to hundreds of millennia, and the most direct and highest temporal resolution record of past atmospheric and precipitation chemistry, come from polar and alpine ice cores. Ice deposits in caves and lava tubes (see Fig. 1) are the lesser known and investigated members of the cryosphere (i.e., the frozen water part of the Earth system), although they allow for detailed paleoenvironmental reconstructions in regions where no other such records exist. The ratios of naturally occurring oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in ice samples can provide important information about temperature, source of moisture, and droughts.  Thus, climate changes can be characterized for the time period spanned by the ice core record by precisely measuring the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope variations, denoted as &delta;18O and &delta;2H, respectively.   The overarching research objective of this proposal is to reconstruct hydroclimate, drought, and temperature in the Southwest over the past 3000 years using ice cores from lava tubes in the El Malpais National Monument (ELMA) in western New Mexico, a region that harbors high-elevations lava tubes with perennial ice deposits of great interest and promising potential for drought studies.  Although these ELMA lava tubes are at over 2000 m in elevation, the ice accumulations in them are not immune to current climate warming. In fact, glaciological observations carried out over the past 15 years in one of the lava tubes indicate the ice is rapidly disappearing. The critical nature of this pilot project is the capturing of paleoclimate information stored in ice cores from a selected number of lava tubes in ELMA before this data is lost to ice melting. Over 15 lava tubes were investigated, but only three of them (lava tubes 29, 91, and 455) allowed ice cores longer than one meter to be recovered. For safety and conservation reasons, the National Park Service prefers to identify the cave by number instead of providing their names or exact locations.   The ice cores (see Fig. 2) were photographed, described (stratigraphy, ice features, color, transparency, etc.), and sub-sampled (0.8 mm to 2 cm resolution) while in the cave.  They were stored in zipped plastic bags and allowed to melt at ambient temperature. Once ice melted, each water sample was transferred into high-density polyethylene bottles (8 mL for stable isotope and 125 mL for dating/geochemical analyses) and shipped to the USF Stable Isotope/Geochemical Lab in Tampa, FL.  Because establishing a reliable chronology is essential in any paleoclimatic study, we performed radiocarbon and uranium-series analyses on organic matter (charcoal) and ice-melted water.    The major outcomes of the project are:  Generated a composite ice core record back to 7000 years before present (BP) Produced a 6000-yr long (7000 to 1000 years BP) isotope-based hydroclimate reconstruction for the SW USA Identified time intervals with enhanced El Ni&ntilde;o and North American Monsoon events Ancestral Puebloans entered lava tubes as early as 4000 years ago to melt ice fro drinking and ritual purposes During periods of enhanced La Ni&ntilde;a conditions (less snow over the winter), the following summers are drier. Such conditions are exacerbated (severe droughts) when La Ni&ntilde;a is in phase with negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation and weak North American Monsoon.    Four USF students (two undergraduates and two graduates) were trained in collecting ice cores, performing stable isotope analysis, computer coding, and interpreting the data.  Two of them, Quinton Vitteli-Hawkins and Laura Calabro completed their MS theses and prepared an educational poster now on display at the ELMA Visitor Center in Grants, NM.  Over the time life of this project the two students and the PI made seven presentations at national and international scientific meetings, published two papers, and have one under review.
