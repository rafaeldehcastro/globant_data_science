<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[To minimize the spread of the novel coronavirus within their communities, colleges and universities around the nation have closed their campuses.  Most have also decided to pivot to online instruction so students can continue their education and remain on track in their degree programs.  To accomplish this goal, faculty in all disciplines have scrambled to quickly move their in-person classes to an online environment.  Many of these faculty have not had previous experience teaching online.  Many who have experience are not fluent with either the technologies or the most effective methods for teaching and learning in online environments. This project will systematically explore the ways in which physics faculty members around the nation, under enormous time pressure, are interacting with each other in online networks as they transition their physics courses online. These online networks can also help faculty navigate the stresses of teaching online and the anxiety of ensuring that students have a beneficial educational experience. This project will gather and analyze data to describe the characteristics of these networks and how they may support the transition to online teaching of physics and other STEM disciplines during a crisis and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Academic and social networks are critical elements of student life in STEM, and they are also important for instructors.  During this crisis, faculty are drawing on professional social networks to support their transition to online teaching. Additional research is needed to understand these informal faculty networks and to link these networks to outcomes for faculty and students. Because the coronavirus-related transition to online teaching has been so urgent and widespread, the situation presents a unique setting in which to apply techniques of social network analysis to study the roles of professional networks on a large scale within a discipline. To this end, the project will collect data from three primary components: (1) a survey of physics faculty as they transition to online teaching; (2) follow-up interviews with faculty; and (3) Twitter data-scraping to identify groups that are promoting and sharing approaches to online teaching. The three data sets will be connected and collectively contribute to analyses of network growth, resource sharing, personal community growth, and mediation of anxiety among college physics faculty. The study intends to reveal the extent to which the crisis has: 1) mobilized latent networks and formed new networks around physics teaching; 2) made such networks more salient and productive; 3) built faculty members' efficacy beliefs about their ability to teach physics online; and 4) mediated their anxiety about teaching online. In addition to revealing how faculty networks are localized and nationalized, the results can contribute to a greater understanding of how social networks influence instructional decision-making on different scales.  If so, these results can inform future longitudinal studies of the persistence of educational transformations that occur during a crisis response, which may have generalizable application in understanding institutional change successes and failures.  This RAPID award is made by the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EHR) program in the Division of Undergraduate Education (Directorate for Education and Human Resources).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this RAPID project was to investigate how professional networks might boost faculty self-efficacy and mediate anxiety during the crisis transition to remote instruction in spring 2020. The project focused on data collection and preliminary analysis. The three arms of data collection were: surveys of physics faculty shortly after they transitioned to online teaching, follow-up interviews with a subset of faculty, and Twitter data scraping to explore online physics teaching networks. A second-round survey was also sent at the end of fall 2020 to look for changes in faculty’s responses after an additional semester or quarter of experience with remote instruction.  In analyzing the first-round survey responses, we found that faculty strongly preferred local experts when seeking advice. They first went to peers in their own departments, then campus teaching centers. Materials distributed by professional societies or education research organizations were not heavily used, nor were social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook. Most faculty had little or no experience teaching online, and faculty were more anxious about teaching in this environment. However, 90% of faculty rated their effectiveness as average or above for the transition.  The project generated large amounts of text data from an open-response survey question and from interview transcripts. The survey text data was examined using sentiment analysis, which found a slightly positive average sentiment score in both the initial (summer 2020) and follow-up (fall 2020) surveys.  As a RAPID proposal, this project was limited in duration and scope, but there are several future routes that might build on it. These include: in-depth analysis of the interview transcripts; additional text analysis with natural language processing, and more detailed comparison of the initial and follow-up survey results.  In terms of implications for instruction, faculty’s clear preference for consulting local sources suggests that professional societies might work to develop instructional "point persons" within departments. Close colleagues are more likely to be consulted than even expert online sources, so it is important to foster better awareness of effective teaching techniques at the local level rather than in centralized repositories.
