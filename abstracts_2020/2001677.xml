<AbstractNarration>Nanoscale materials such as nanotubes, nanofilms, and nanopillars, composed of carbon, metallic or ceramic material, have been found to exhibit near theoretical strength, damage tolerance, energy conversion and optical properties in their pristine form. When these nanoscale elements are precisely architected into well-defined, three-dimensional topologies, they form macroscopic structures that can reach near-theoretical strength with only a fraction of the mass densities of the starting materials. If such nano-architected structures are manufacturable, many applications are possible, e.g., ultra-lightweight, energy-absorbing materials, tissue engineering scaffolds, energy conversion and wave manipulation devices. Current nanofabrication technologies, based on laser-writing, are incapable of creating these nanostructures in dimensions larger than a few millimeters. While a variety of additive manufacturing approaches are capable of creating complex macroscopic three-dimensional objects, they have not achieved capabilities for creating architectures with nanoscale features. This project will advance knowledge in scalable nanomanufacturing of macroscopic objects comprised of precisely defined, three-dimensional nano-architectures for lightweighting and resilience. The researchers will conduct theoretical and experimental studies to understand, predict and control the interactions between light field, digital optics, and feedstock materials, leading to reliable production of large area, three-dimensional nano-architectures. The research requires understanding fundamental science and engineering disciplines, including nanomanufacturing, optics, mechanics, mechatronics, physics, and chemistry. The research results will be integrated into new curricula and projects to give hands-on research and education opportunities for high school, undergraduate, graduate and under-represented students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to build the theoretical and experimental foundations underpinning scalable additive nanomanufacturing, overcoming existing barrier in 3D printing, which is to achieve nano-scale precision. The research studies a process to create three-dimensional architectures with nanoscale features under controlled sub-wavelength light field projection onto feedstock primitives. To achieve optimal production speed, a multi-physics based modeling and experimental platforms are established to elucidate the kinetics governing the speed and resolution of the new printing mechanism. The research is then implemented with a new set of instrumentations that enable the parallel production of large area samples with nano-architectures. Additionally, this research establishes theoretical and experimental frameworks to predict and prevent defect generation while scaling up to dimensions over several orders of magnitude. This research enables a new concept of creating three-dimensional nano-architectures. It provides a scientific and engineering basis towards reliable upscaling of nano-architectures to components and devices for applications including structural supports, energy storage and conversion, and wave manipulations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the project is to build the theoretical and experimental foundations underpinning scalable additive manufacturing of structures with nanoscale features, overcoming existing barrier in 3D printing, which is to achieve high resolution over larger area. In this research we have investigated the mechanism of nanoscale materials assembly into three-dimensional architectures with nanoscale features. These materials include graphene that contains nano-graphene oxide and UV sensitive inks as the printing precursor, nano-particles and carbon nanotubes functionalized with UV sensitive inks.&nbsp;We have developed the first lithography based method to fabricate truly arbitrary 3D graphene aerogel structures. Our work has focused on variations in processing including material loading, dispersion time, and pyrolysis temperature, which can have significant effects on the delicate nanoscale topologies within these architected graphene aerogels. We formulated processing-property relationships to maximize the nanoscale porosity, conductivity, and mechanical strength of the architected graphene which will open these intricate structures to a host of applications including energy storage, catalysis, and as biomedical scaffolds. Additionally, our work provides insight into fabricating porous 3D structures from various nanomaterials beyond graphene, including high-temp ceramics, carbon nanotubes, nano-particles.&nbsp;These lightweight, three-dimensional micro- and nano- lattices represent a promising class of low-density materials), with numerous applications like thermal insulation, battery electrodes&nbsp; and energy absorption to name a few. At an overall volume of millimeter cubic, they achieve remarkable mechanical and functional properties, governed in part by the parent material and in part by their architecture and hence commonly referred to as mechanical metamaterials. However, due to insufficient built volumes of these materials, an investigation of their nanoscale size effect and sensitivity to defects, cracks and fracture is elusive due to the limitations of additive manufacturing techniques. Our study used a stretch-dominated&nbsp; &nbsp;metamaterial, comprising a network of struts where the nodes are arranged in a face centred cubic (fcc) lattice - the so-called octet-truss . Fabrication of large 3D specimens, comprising of nearly 10 million periodic cells and cell sizes as small as, was accomplished using a novel large area projection micro-stereolithography (SLA) system where each layer is fabricated via a continuously moving projection so curing occurs in sub-sections. This enables the creation of metamaterial specimens with millions of unit cells and homogeneous mechanical properties. The system utilizes a dynamic, co-ordinated optical scanning system to continuously project and scan two-dimensional (2D) slices onto an ultra-violet (UV) curable photopolymer to produce large-scale three-dimensional (3D) parts. This enables us to manufacture specimens with embedded cracks and with a sufficient number of unit cells so as to develop a -field and thereby perform a range of valid fracture toughness measurements. The results testify that the finite unit cell sizes restrict the development of singular stresses, with the consequence that alone is an insufficient parameter to characterize fracture. Via a combination of measurements, including in-situ X-ray computed tomographic (XCT) observation and large-scale numerical simulations (with billions of degrees of freedom), we demonstrated that classic continuum mechanics is inadequate to characterize the failure of architected metamaterials and thus formulated a comprehensive experimental and theoretical methodology to evaluate and quantify the failure of metamaterials over a wide range of specimen densities, parent materials, cell sizes, crack sizes as well as loading configurations. This research results will enable the design and realization of resilient metamaterials that sustain cracks under a variety of loading conditions (published on Nature Materials, 2022). <span> </span>This research has created diverse education and outreach activities that promote K-12 and public education and cross-disciplinary graduate workshop for the teams from the PI's additive manufacturing and metamaterials labs, as well as medical researchers at UCLA, students in multiple departments including mechanical engineering, civil engineering, bioengineering, material science and engineering as well as electrical engineering.&nbsp; Two US Patents, and more than 8 journal publications are produced as a result of this work.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/22/2022<br>      Modified by: Xiaoyu&nbsp;Zheng</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647997732987_c8mh00668g-f1_hi-res--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647997732987_c8mh00668g-f1_hi-res--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Printed nano-architected graphene"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647997732987_c8mh00668g-f1_hi-res--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Printed nano-architected graphene"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A) Four �Green� MAG parts of differing unit-cell structures before pyrolysis from left to right octet-truss, gyroid, cubo-octahedron, and Kelvin foam; (B) optical image of pyrolyzed gyroid; (C) SEM image of pyrolyzed gyroid with intricate overhang structures (D) zoomed image of pyrolyzed gyroid in �</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaoyu (Rayne) Zheng</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaoyu&nbsp;Zheng</div> <div class="imageTitle">Printed nano-architected graphene</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647997819561_c8mh00668g-f3_hi-res--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647997819561_c8mh00668g-f3_hi-res--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Elemental confirmation of 3D graphene"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647997819561_c8mh00668g-f3_hi-res--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Elemental confirmation of 3D graphene"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">) SEM of XGO MAG (B) zoomed SEM of XGO MAG showing porous nature of strut (C) TEM of XGO MAG showing sheet wrinkling and imperfect stacking (D) zoomed TEM showing stacking on the order of 4�5 graphene layers (E) micro-Raman analysis of XGO MAG and XGO aerogel showing identical MAG aerogel microstruc</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ryan Hensleigh, Xiaoyu Zheng</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaoyu&nbsp;Zheng</div> <div class="imageTitle">Elemental confirmation of 3D graphene</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647997932412_ceramicsintering--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647997932412_ceramicsintering--rgov-800width.jpg" title="High temp ceramic"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647997932412_ceramicsintering--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="High temp ceramic"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ultrafast sintering of 3D printed high-temp ceramic</div> <div class="imageCredit">Huachen Cui and Xiaoyu Zheng</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaoyu&nbsp;Zheng</div> <div class="imageTitle">High temp ceramic</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647998115398_XCT--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647998115398_XCT--rgov-800width.jpg" title="XCT image of large area metamaterials"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2001677/2001677_10502629_1647998115398_XCT--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="XCT image of large area metamaterials"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Large area metamaterials with 8 million unit cells</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaoyu Zheng and Vikram Deshpande</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaoyu&nbsp;Zheng</div> <div class="imageTitle">XCT image of large area metamaterials</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
