<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The ability to use energetically costly physiological processes to maintain body temperature at levels elevated above ambient temperature or endothermy, is a defining characteristic of mammals. The evolution of endothermy allowed mammals from warm, aseasonal climates to diversify and radiate into previously inhospitable environments as temperatures cooled.   Much of what is known about temperature regulation and energetics in mammals, however, has been derived from high latitude, northern hemisphere species whose evolutionary history has been shaped by large changes in temperature and extreme seasonality.  To address this gap, the PI will leverage an existing collaboration, to examine the costs of living for nocturnal and diurnal small mammals in the tropical forests of Malaysian Borneo.  The PI and her team will collect long term data on the body temperatures, metabolic rates, and life history characteristics of free-living small mammals. A novel, comprehensive database of mammalian physiological and life history traits, will be generated providing access to new, real data as a valuable learning experiences for the impact of climate on mammalian energetics. Education activities will target University of Maine undergraduate and graduate students, and K-12 students throughout Maine. Through first-hand experience with novel datasets from a unique environment, students will learn the importance of thermoregulatory physiology in understanding how animals respond to their environment. By increasing our knowledge of the functional energetics of tropical mammals not only can we understand the mechanisms underpinning current species distributions, but also help to improve our predictions of organismal responses to changing global climates.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of this early career project is to build a framework to better understand the macrophysiology of mammals and better predict their potential responses to a warming world, by integrating physiology, ecology, and evolutionary biology. A high degree of biodiversity, endemism, and an almost complete lack of basic data physiological data available for small mammals from the Indo-Malayan zoogeographic region, creates an ideal arena in which to stage a long-term project of integrated research and education. The PI and her team seek to answer the following questions: 1) do nocturnal small mammals have more flexible body temperatures than their diurnal counterparts; 2) does it cost more (in terms of energy and water) to be nocturnal or diurnal in a consistently hot and humid environment and, 3) how will these differences affect their ability to respond to climate change. Through answering these questions, the research will generate novel datasets on the physiology and energetics of six or more species of tropical small mammals. When combined with existing data from temperate mammals, these data will be used test hypotheses on the evolution of homeothermy, and the role of energetics in the life history of mammals. Ultimately, the research will generate a comprehensive framework for using mammalian thermoregulatory phenotypes in modeling mammalian responses to climate. The research aims of this proposal will be integrated with education activities that will target undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Maine and K-12 students throughout the state. Through first-hand experience with novel datasets from a unique environments, will learn demonstrate the importance of thermoregulatory physiology in understanding how animals respond to their environment, while providing research and outreach opportunities for junior scientists and the general public.  Together the knowledge of the functional energetics of tropical mammals will advance the understanding of mechanisms controlling current species distributions, but also help to improve our predictions of organismal responses to changing global climates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER proposal was supported by the Integrative Ecological Physiology Program within the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems within the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Program within the Office of Integrative Activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
