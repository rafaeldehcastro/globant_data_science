<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a low-cost organic light emitting diode (OLED).  The improved economics of this OLED could bring this lighting closer to the price point required to be competitive in high-efficiency commercial lighting or in low-cost displays, such as monitors and calculators.  Reduced cost in existing OLED products (phones, TVs) will also prove a significant boon for users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the premise that inefficient interfaces between materials within the OLED stack are a significant source of performance loss.  As a result, excess materials must be used (or expensive work arounds must be applied) to maintain an acceptable performance, but at a higher cost.  The suitability of alternative technologies to improve interfacial issues in an industrial relevant manner is evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This I-Corps award supported evaluation of the market potential for two coating technologies related to organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic transistors.  Evaluations were performed via interviews with industry stakeholders including manufacturers, materials providers, and packagers/end users.  For both applications, several new and competing technologies were found, while the team was surprised by the large number non-technological barriers to entry present, which need to be circumvented before commercialization.  OLED coatings were found to have modest market potential while the transistor-based coatings had little to none.  Based on the market information for the former, continued development is planned in the academic research lab while concurrently marshaling the necessary resources to pursue this opportunity in a standalone entity.     Concurrent to market evaluation, the three team members underwent transformative education via the formal I-Corps curriculum and are now versed in market assessment, product valuation, revenue models, identifying decision makers, etc.  The training provided over a six week period prepared team members for essential roles within startups pertaining to this or alternative technologies.  Additionally, conversations with the various stakeholders initiated the necessary connections needed for success of any future ventures.  Finally, the grant has facilitated discussions and actions within the host university on the infrastructure/environment needed to nurture a spinoff.
