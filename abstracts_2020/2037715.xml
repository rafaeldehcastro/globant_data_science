<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the development of ultra-clear, super-insulating aerogels. Insulated glass manufacturers have a need for improvements to existing double-pane window manufacturing.  Residential insulated glass units represent a $2 billion market in North America alone. Currently, windows in the U.S. lose $20 billion dollars in energy each winter. A double-pane window with a sheet of aerogel between glass panes can achieve a vastly improved insulation, as an aerogel thickness of just 3 mm enables a product 50% more insulating than gas-filled double-pane windows, comparable to triple-pane products. Adoption could enable cost-effective energy savings of 1.2 quadrillion BTUs by 2030. This work also extends to other markets, such as transparent doors for refrigeration and ovens, and solar thermal receivers for process heat, which also represent significant opportunities for energy savings and viable market applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address key technical barriers for integration of super-insulating aerogels in window insulated glass units by focusing on two main risks. First, the project will further improve the optical clarity of the aerogel materials. The human eye is highly sensitive to haze and defects in transparent media, and although optical clarity meeting minimum requirements for the residential window market has been achieved, further improvement and testing are needed. Clarity will be improved by reducing haze through solution-gelation recipe optimization and by removing the fundamental causes of surface defects through development of mixing and molding strategies. Second, widespread adoption also requires straightforward incorporation of aerogel into insulated glass units. Bonding methods to attach aerogels directly to glass without reducing optical clarity will be developed, which will enable simple handling and incorporation into existing insulated glass unit manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Under&nbsp;this Phase I award, AeroShield increased aerogel sheet size to 14"x20" sheets starting from ~5"x5" aerogels at the beginning of the project. 14"x20" sheets are a significant achievement because it is a standard industry test size for window and insulated glass unit manufacturers, positioning AeroShield to develop a window product and engage with customers. We confirmed that we were able to achieve these sizes while maintaining haze between 1.5 to 2%, adequate for first products. AeroShield also reduced surface defects that occur in our manufacturing process by exploring the origin of the defects and then designing sheet molding strategies that mitigate the cause of the defects. Under this award, we also categorized several defect types for quality control inspection while scaling production of our material. Finally, AeroShield developed two distinct strategies to adhere aerogel sheets to glass and determined that these methods can create bonding that does not significantly reduce the aerogel's optical quality. These bonding methods were used to create 14"x20" prototypes such as the one pictured. We tested the aerogel/glass bonded units to 2500 hours of UV exposure and observed no degradation in optical properties due to the bond under UV exposure, promising both a scalable and UV stable bond solution. These demonstrations were crucial to attract commercial partners, who are now helping AeroShield test and design aerogel insulated glass units. Furthermore, the demonstrations AeroShield achieved during this Phase I project and the resulting commercial engagement were also pivotal for a seed investment round that will help fund AeroShield's continued development.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/29/2022<br>      Modified by: Kyle&nbsp;Wilke</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2037715/2037715_10716512_1651204313516_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2037715/2037715_10716512_1651204313516_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Aerogel Window Prototype"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2037715/2037715_10716512_1651204313516_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Aerogel Window Prototype"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Under this NSF award, AeroShield began scaling production of our ultraclear aerogel up to 14"x20" sheets, a standard test size in the window industry.</div> <div class="imageCredit">AeroShield</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kyle&nbsp;Wilke</div> <div class="imageTitle">Aerogel Window Prototype</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
