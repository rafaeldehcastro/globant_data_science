<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide a life-saving treatment option to patients suffering from a specific heart condition called tricuspid regurgitation (TR). In the US, 1.6 million patients need treatment for life-threatening TR, and no good medical, surgical, or transcatheter therapy exists. Current solutions lead to bleeding complications, damage to the circulatory system, or inability to deliver the device. This project will develop a novel device to address these constraints with a method that can be manufactured at scale, resulting in significant cost savings to the healthcare system and improved quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will enable the development of a new transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement device and novel technology to produce 3D physical vapor deposition (PVD) nitinol thin-film leaflets. One of the main challenges in valve development is a design that can be compressed into a catheter successfully. The use of a thin film rather than the standard of pericardial tissue will significantly reduce the volume of the valve material, enabling a much smaller delivery catheter profile. This study addresses critical developmental objectives, such as manufacturing feasibility and thin film leaflet characteristics. The solution will be optimized for material fatigue life, valve characteristics, valve durability, and anchoring to validate it for medical use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  More than 1.6 million patients in the United States suffer from moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The presence of moderate to severe TR is associated with poor prognosis, with as many as 36% of patients dying within one year.  However, due to the high mortality and morbidity of surgical tricuspid valve repair or replacement, only 8,000 surgeries are performed annually.  There is not yet any approved transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement device on the market. Nininger Medical is developing a Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement (TTVR) device that will overcome these challenges.   This NSF Phase I SBIR project provided support for early-stage feasibility studies of a novel valve leaflet material that will be more durable, cheaper to manufacture, and deliverable through a smaller catheter than other materials commonly used in heart valve replacement devices.  It also supported feasibility studies of a novel frame design that would support the valve and anchor it in the heart. Successful commercialization of the proof of concept established in this Phase I project will ultimately benefit individuals living with congestive heart failure due to tricuspid regurgitation, leading to improved quality of life and longer lifespan for these patients.  More broadly, this technology could have a game-changing effect on the manufacture of other heart valves for both surgical and transcatheter applications, including mitral, aortic, and pulmonic valves, by completely replacing the need for pericardial tissue in these devices.  This would bring down the price of these devices significantly, resulting in large savings for the healthcare system and rapid market adoption.  Additionally, the longer durability of these devices may lead to a reduction in the need for re-intervention in these patients. Data from pre-clinical and clinical studies of this device are expected to be published upon completion of those studies in later phases of this project.
