<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic depends on linguistic and cultural factors as well as social and economic ones.  This is a special concern for indigenous and immigrant communities for whom information about the pandemic and important health actions may not match their language or health practices. Given the dangers of the pandemic and the importance of appropriate information sharing, the project aims to answer an overarching question: What can be done to increase understanding in a context of incipient multilingualism and multiculturalism? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three stages. Stage 1 examines how bilingual individuals with low levels of proficiency in the dominant language interpret healthcare messages related to COVID-19, and whether their interpretation is dependent on language proficiency and cultural framing. Phone/Skype interviews will be conducted in which target concepts/vocabulary associated with COVID-19 will be discussed. The PIs will assess the extent to which members of non-dominant linguistic and cultural communities display a disadvantage in understanding health messages and, therefore, will be more vulnerable to health crises. The interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and translated. At Stages 2-3, the PIs will develop and field a procedure for presenting the necessary concepts related to the COVID-19 and other potential health crises which are linguistically differentiated and culturally appropriate not only for the population under investigation but for general use in a multilingual/multicultural context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When the pandemic news became available via domestic and international structures (2020-2021), most related information was delivered in socially dominant languages, using avenues and norms consonant with the dominant language structures. This had direct consequences for indigenous communities, who received limited information about the pandemic in their own languages. Additionally, the method of information delivery did not match their culturally accepted practices regarding health management, resulting in consequences on the health profile of the already minoritized communities.     This project examines how information about COVID-19 was received by speakers of several minoritized communities using a novel crisis-readiness survey co-created with indigenous speakers.      Methods:     Over a period of 1.5 years during the height of the pandemic (2020-2022), a semi-structured survey was administered in the indigenous (L1) languages to 175  speakers (ages 18-81) of Cuzco Quechua (7 rural communities in the South of Peru, N=71, 2020), Shipibo-Konibo (2 rural communities in the Amazonian Center of Peru, N=38, 2020), Puerto-Rican Spanish (multiple communities, N=30, 2021), Ca?ari Kichwa (1 rural community in the South of Ecuador, N=30, 2022), Anishinaabemowin (4 communities in Manitoba; 1 in Ontario, Canada, N=7, 2022).  The participants were surveyed by phone/skype or in person by community researchers who speak the languages and participated in the project as members of the collaborative international research team. Responses were audio recorded as part of a large documentation effort.      Tool: A questionnaire was developed, fully translatable into different linguistic varieties, and currently available in 9 languages. It elicits language samples which can be collected using various platforms and utilized for the creation of health education and language documentation/revitalization materials.     The questionnaire elicits three types of information: (i) demographic, language history, attitudes, and patterns of language use; (ii) perceptions about the virus, risks, symptoms, and prevention of the disease; and (iii) statements based on a series of World Health Organization myth(busters), culturally adapted and translated to the indigenous languages.  Several versions of the survey are available, correspondent with the profile of the community and the different stages of the pandemic (pre- vs. post-availability of vaccines).      Outcomes:    A. Language Documentation     All of the consented data were transcribed, translated, and made publicly available for other research. The data have been shared with the communities in various formats via community researchers: as datasets, as infographics, as (follow-up) media, and as transcribed corpora. Community researchers are the first authors on the resulting corpora.   B. Crisis Readiness      The collected questionnaire data were analyzed using several statistical models and relying on several variables corresponding with different research questions. To date, the Quechua, Shipibo-Konibo, and Puerto Rican Spanish data have been analyzed; other datasets (Kichwa and Anishinaabemowin) remain under analysis.      The descriptive data across the five languages in the study suggest that the community members were not clear on several crucial aspects of the information related to COVID-19, its risks, prevention, and cure possibilities.     Broadly, the data from Quechua, Shipibo-Konibo, and Puerto-Rican Spanish indicate a similar trend in the three groups such that those participants who reported hearing information about the pandemic from healthcare providers were more likely to report being elderly as a risk factor for COVID-19. Further, the perception of ?myths? articulated by the World Health Organization was predicted by demographic and language factors. Among the Quechua and Shipibo-Konibo speakers, those who reported having access to a day-clinic were more likely to mention comorbidity as a risk factor. Most participants in both groups perceived the central government?s role in information about deaths but not about cure or treatment. Among the Puerto Rican Spanish speakers, those who reported not engaging in the alternate use of Spanish and English also reported their desire to receive healthcare information from clinics or health professionals.        Shipibo-Konibo speakers and male Quechua speakers with high levels of proficiency in the Indigenous languages considered drinking alcohol dangerous for people who contract COVID, and not a cure. A majority of participants in these groups stated they received COVID information either in both languages or only in Spanish.  Results revealed group differences between Quechua and Shipibo-speaking participants regarding beliefs about transmission of COVID-19 by insect bites possibly due to geolocation differences. Female participants were more likely to believe that bleach can be used as cure for COVID. The statement about masks and gloves not being necessary if one is healthy was considered false by female Quechua participants and Shipibo participants with higher levels of proficiency in the Indigenous language.    Summary:    Overall, these results highlight the importance of providing healthcare information in Indigenous languages to minoritized populations and to do so through clinics and healthcare facilities.  Furthermore, it reveals the need to take into account cultural differences when assessing the type of information that minoritized communities access.
