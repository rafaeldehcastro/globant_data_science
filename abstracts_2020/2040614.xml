<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports use-inspired, team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and will produce deliverables of value to society in the near future. This project seeks to develop a national quantum literacy workforce network to broaden and increase participation. By applying fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency (FEAT) to develop quantum literacy frameworks, this project aims to engage diverse communities in quantum science. Partners include those from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs), national laboratories, industry, and nonprofits who will develop a taxonomy, curriculum, training and national network to enhance quantum literacy at a national scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to increase the participation of historically underrepresented groups in quantum science through its diverse network as well as through its curriculum and training. The building of a national quantum literacy workforce ecosystem includes four pathways: (1) identifying quantum literacy taxonomic nomenclature utilized in industry settings; (2) conceptualizing a quantum literacy curriculum design informed by industry; (3) designing training modalities that are adaptable to various industries; and (4) building a national network of academics, businesses, nonprofits, government and national laboratories. The curriculum aims to be widely accessible and used by those in industry, students, academics as well as government and nonprofits. By assisting end-users to gain an understanding of the quantum concepts, this project will enhance a quantum literate communities. With a focus on building the network with those from HBCUs, MBEs, governments labs, industry, and nonprofits, this project aims to transform and strengthen the quantum workforce and will be a resource for those engaging in diversity efforts in quantum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
