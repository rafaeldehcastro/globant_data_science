<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Ultrahard protective coatings are critical in applications ranging from microelectronics packaging to cutting tools needed for oil and gas extraction and high-speed machining. Performance improvement directly scales with the hardness enhancement of protective coatings. This proposal focuses on design and synthesis of ultrahard materials, striving to be harder than diamond — the hardest material known so far. By using a novel approach based upon rapid laser melting and quenching, it is possible to create diamond or new Q- phases of carbon which are significantly harder. Since this process can be performed at ambient temperatures and pressures, there is a significant reduction in energy usage and manufacturing of Q-carbon and diamond-related materials. This research is being integrated with the curriculum development and related educational activities, such as M.S. Nano program. The proposal addresses training of graduate and undergraduate students in collaboration with ORNL, Kopin Corporation and NC A&amp;T to attract minority students into the graduate studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Diamond and Q-phase related materials are synthesized by nanosecond laser melting of carbon films and rapid quenching from the undercooled state. The degree of undercooling determines this direct conversion into diamond or Q-carbon or a mixture of the two. Modeling is carried out to understand laser-solid interactions and correlations between hardness and number density of atoms.  In this project, different Q-carbon and diamond mixtures are synthesized by controlling laser, film and sapphire substrate variables. These phases are characterized by using high-resolution electron microscopy, electron-energy-loss spectroscopy and Raman techniques, and direct correlations with enhanced hardness and toughness established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Narayan, John C. C. Fan Family Distinguished Chair in Materials Science, NAE member   Background and Introduction:  The hardness (H) of solids is directly related to shear modulus (&micro;) by H = &alpha;&micro;, where &alpha; is a constant with a value of about 0.2. The relation of hardness with Young’s modulus (E)  and bulk modulus in an isotropic solid (B) involves Poisson’s ratio (&nu;), which is the measure of transverse contraction to longitudinal extension.  The hardness (H) is related to E and B by H = &alpha; E [2(1 + &nu;)]-1 = 3&alpha; B (1 -2 &nu;) [2(1 + &nu;)]-1. The diamond has the highest hardness because of the highest bulk modulus, arising from covalently bonded strong &sigma; bonds, and relatively low value of Poisson’s ratio of about 0.1.  We show that the bulk modulus is directly related to the number density of atoms. The highest hardness of diamond is directly related to the highest number density of atoms (1.77x1023 atoms cm-3). To exceed this value of hardness, we have increased the number density of covalently bonded atoms in the new lattice.  It is interesting to note that despite the highest number density of atoms, the diamond cubic lattice has the lowest atomic packing fraction of only 34%, compared to 74% (FCC, HCP), 68% (BCC) and 56% (Simple Cubic) lattices. Thus diamond cubic lattice has 66% of the empty space, which, if utilized cleverly, can lead to higher hardness.    The diamond cubic unit cell consists of four tetradedra with central atoms, which have number density of atoms of 16/a3, and four missing tetrahedra alternately. These four missing tetrahedra average out the number density of atoms to 8/a3. By using the diamond tetrahedron as the basic structural unit, we able to create novel Q-diamond and Q-carbon based materials with much higher (&gt;60%) number density of atoms than diamond and achieve considerably higher hardness as much as 70% higher than that of diamond.  Final Outcomes:  A new paradigm in designing ultrahard materials has been demonstrated with a proof-of-concept.  In this approach, the basic structural unit is pure or doped carbon tetrahedra with strongly bonded covalent bonds. Since the number density of atoms in a carbon tetrahedron is 16/a3 compared to 8/a3 for diamond cubic lattice (a = lattice constant of diamond), it is possible to achieve higher (&gt;60%) than that of diamond by packing them randomly.

Depending upon the available time, we form distinct phases of Q-carbon based upon the number of tetrahedra involved in the basic structural unit.
