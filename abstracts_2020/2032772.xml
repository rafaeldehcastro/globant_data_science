<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of students from US-based institutions in the Doctoral Consortium at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2020, which will be held virtually due to COVID-19. CVPR is the premier annual conference in computer vision with over 9000 participants from all over the world. The award helps the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in computer vision to increase the number of active researchers and educators in STEM and ensures that the computer vision community, through its recent graduates, makes fast advances in solving problems that will benefit society as a whole. The Doctoral Consortium aims to have representation from a diverse group of participants in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support covers some of the costs for 40 selected US-based graduate students to participate in the Doctoral Consortium and CVPR conference. The Doctoral Consortium highlights the work of senior PhD students who are within six months of receiving their degrees (including recent graduates) and gives these students an opportunity to discuss their research and career options with faculty and researchers who have relevant expertise and experience. The opportunity to receive advice on their research work and career plans from experts from different institutions is particularly important due to the uncertainty of job prospects and disruption of traditional networking and recruiting events caused by COVID-19. Participants and recipients of support are selected by the 2020 CVPR Doctoral Consortium Chair. The support covers admissible conference-related costs such as registration. This year's Doctoral Consortium features a poster session, one-on-one mentoring, and panel discussion, all held virtually. These components were introduced in past doctoral consortiums and were well received.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
