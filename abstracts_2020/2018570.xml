<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a photonic 3D printer  for the rapid fabrication of nano- to macro-scale parts and maskless lithography.  As the only system of its kind in the state, it will enable users at Purdue and throughout the region to pursue new fundamental research directions by eliminating fabrication bottlenecks and design limitations.  The team will   integrate the instrumentation into ongoing education and outreach activities and will leverage the College of Engineeringâ€™s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow program and the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program for undergraduate research using the system. The PIs will work with middle and high school students -- in collaboration with Deaf Kids CODE--enabling students to design and 3D print their own microrobots and to write code to control them -- exposing the students to the worlds of microtechnology, controls, and microrobotics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation will enable interdisciplinary fundamental research in a range of fields including microrobotics, materials, sensors, devices, metamaterials, and programmable structures. The potentially transformative fundamental research can advance understanding of nanoscale physics during phase change from liquid to gas by enabling fabrication of nanopores for nanoscale evaporation.  The fundamental research on materials and metamaterials can lead to novel phase transforming materials that can be used to design and fabricate energy absorption systems at the nano-scale.  The research on microrobotics may advance fundamental knowledge on the navigation and control of micro-robots through vision-based micro-force sensing systems and how such robots might be scaled-down for biomedical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The pilot use period was extended through the end of the Spring 2022 semester to get all necessary accessories and procedures in place.  Based on pilot usage period, an hourly rate of $18/hour for use of GT2 system was established and implemented in May 2022.  Staff support training for the system occurred in June 2022 and the system was opened to the entire BNC-user community in July 2022.  The system has billed almost 1700 hours of use through June 2023.  There are 25 active trained users from 12 different labs, across 5 departments and 3 colleges at Purdue University.     The acquisition of this system has lowered the barrier to entry for those interested in micro-scale research and make it possible for new students to make substantial research contributions early on in their research careers. Further, because the team of PIs and Senior Personnel spans six departments/schools in the Purdue College of Engineering, students from a variety of backgrounds have received training on this state-of-the-art piece of equipment.  The GT2 is now a regular tour stop during tours of the Purdue BNC, where visitors can learn about two photon lithography techniques that the GT2 employs.  Finally, research products generated as a result of using the system have been disseminated to the research community at large.
