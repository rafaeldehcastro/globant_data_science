<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Migration within and across borders has important political, social, and economic implications. This project will analyze migration corridors as a conceptual process. As a consequence, this research will alter theories of migration based on relevant laws and policies, media discourse, and trade agreements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this ethnographic study employing a mixed methods approach including interviews and macro-level analyses, this project will examine the development and shifting formation of migration corridors. In doing so, this research will analyze the often intersecting travel itineraries of female migrant workers. By examining migration as a process within and across migration corridors, this project provides an advance in theoretical understanding of migration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
