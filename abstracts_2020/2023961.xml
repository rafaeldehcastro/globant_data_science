<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This EAGER project supports the development of a new inlet for the NSF/NCAR G-V aircraft that will enhance the ability of scientists to measure ambient ions, condensable vapors, and short-lived reactive species in the atmosphere. These types of compounds typically exist in the atmosphere at very low levels, are highly reactive, and are typically lost upon first contact with a surface. Therefore, sampling becomes a critical factor in their measurement. The new inlet will become an important community resource for air sampling from the G-V aircraft. Society will benefit from the improved tools for predicting the sinks of greenhouse gases, the sources of aerosols, and the impact of these on air quality and climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort includes the early stages of the design, construction, and assessment based on computational fluid dynamics simulations, and the Federal Aviation Authority certification of a laminar flow inlet that is pre-requisite for quantitative sampling of condensable vapors and ambient ions; and this effort also explores the feasibility for autonomous startup of an inertia navigation system using differential GPS for inlet-free remote sensing detection of radical species in the open atmosphere. Currently, certified inlets on the G-V aircraft use turbulent air flow regimes that are subject to wall losses, and suitable for the sampling of longer lived species. The autonomous remote-sensing and laminar inlet design will enable the sampling of a multitude of organic and inorganic radical and short lived species not possible with the currently available inlet designs. The new inlet will provide the potential to fill gaps in our understanding of oxidative capacity, and those condensable vapors that add to the early growth of nanoparticles. This research includes the participation of two graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this EAGER proposal is exploratory and is a high-risk, high-reward effort, the extensive experience of the participating scientists and their existing analytical capabilities reduce both the risk and the required investment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project developed inlet technology for use aboard NSF research aircraft to conduct measurements of trace-gases and ambient ions in the atmosphere. The motion sensors and inlet technology developed here enables the miniaturization and autonomous operation of motion-stabilized optical sensors to sample radical species directly in the open atmosphere; and provide novel means to sample ambient ions, condensable vapors and other trace gases that are relevant to the formation of aerosols and clouds. By developing these innovative sampling capabilities the project lays the foundation for better capabilities to inform the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere that controls the lifetime of climate active gases, and informs about the growth mechanisms of nanoparticles that are relevant to questions about how clouds form, and Earth?s energy balance. Currently certified HIAPER aircraft inlets use turbulent air flow regimes that are subject to higher wall losses, and suitable for the sampling of longer lived species. The project address the current lack of sampling capabilities to measure ambient ions, condensable vapors (e.g.,H2SO4, HIO3,etc.), and short-lived reactive species. The development of the laminar flow inlet further extends the ability of CIMS instruments to perform measurements of these short lived, reactive species. No such measurements have been attempted before on theGV due in part to limitations in certified inlets.These and other efforts are aligned with the objective of technological innovation of the TI3GER field campaign, which also includes efforts to further miniaturize instruments, and enable the remote control of instruments from the ground.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/28/2023<br>      Modified by: Rainer&nbsp;M&nbsp;Volkamer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023961/2023961_10658294_1682725400290_CUlaminarflowInlet--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023961/2023961_10658294_1682725400290_CUlaminarflowInlet--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CU laminar flow inlet"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023961/2023961_10658294_1682725400290_CUlaminarflowInlet--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CU laminar flow inlet"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The CU laminar flow inlet installed inside the windtunnel</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rainer Volkamer</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rainer&nbsp;M&nbsp;Volkamer</div> <div class="imageTitle">CU laminar flow inlet</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
