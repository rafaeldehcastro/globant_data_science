<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project funds the inaugural meeting of a new national research organization ,the Atlanta Network for Race, Ethnicity, and Politics (ANREP), comprised of political and social scientists living in and/or studying issues related to racial politics affecting the Southeastern United States. The purpose of this first meeting is to for attendees to critically evaluate workshop papers addressing theoretically-motivated research questions about the 2020 U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections and to provide professional development support to help attendees ultimately publish their papers. In addition, discussion will focus on institutionalizing the organizational framework and plans for the group.   The conference goals align with NSFâ€™s mission to help advance the progress of science and the goal of diversifying the STEM community as it supports research on and by Americans who come from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference and network brings together scholars from Atlanta-area minority serving institutions, including historically Black colleges and minority-serving universities, with faculty from non-MSI research universities, to enhance scholarship, training, and career development in the study of race, ethnicity, and politics. The conference, held at Clark Atlanta University and Emory University in June 2021, uses the 2020 U.S. elections as substantive foci, the conference highlights research on and by African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans. After a national call for papers, the proposed conference showcases 12 papers in four substantive panels, as well as a professional development panel on publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes Report of the Inaugural Conference of the Atlanta Network for Race, Ethnicity and Politics (ANREP)  Submitted by Andra Gillespie, Co-Principal Investigator, Emory University  December 2022     In June 2020, my colleagues and I successfully applied for a Build and Broaden grant to promote scholarship on race and political behavior among graduate students and faculty in the Southeastern United States.  Our plan was to host an academic conference centered on analyzing the 2020 election in June 2021 on the campuses of Emory and Clark Atlanta Universities.  At the conference, attendees would have the opportunity to present papers and receive critical feedback.  There would also be networking opportunities and professional development sessions to help attendees publish their work in leading journals.  Due to the lingering challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organizing committee of the Atlanta Network for Race, Ethnicity and Politics (ANREP) sought and received a no-cost extension.  This extension allowed us to postpone the conference until 2022.  With widespread vaccine availability and proper COVID hygiene, we were able to host the inaugural meeting of ANREP on June 10-11, 2022. After extending a call for papers in Fall 2021 through social media and other channels (such as the listserve for the Race, Ethnicity, and Politics section of the American Political Science Association), we reviewed 21 applications for possible inclusion in the conference.  Of those 21 applications, we accepted 16 proposals.  Eleven sets of authors accepted our invitation to participate in the conference. Including PI's, study staff and student staff workers, 25 people attended at least part of the ANREP conference.  With this level of interest, we were able to organize four research and two professional development panels over the course of the two-day meeting.  In one professional development session, senior faculty provided valuable advice about navigating the job market and tenure process.  The second professional development panel focused on the journal publication process and featured current or former editors the American Political Science Review, the National Review of Black Politics, and Politics, Groups and Identities.     Conference participants were receptive to the feedback their papers received.  At least one paper is currently under review at a journal.  We expect that we will learn of more papers entering the journal review process in the coming months.  We also look forward to future meetings of ANREP.  We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for their support. We hope to be able to work with NSF on future projects, including meetings of ANREP.
