<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This workshop brings together scientists involved in studying atmospheric aerosols at a fundamental level in the laboratory and in the field. The objective of the gathering is to provide molecular level perspectives on aerosol properties that are critical to the impact of aerosols on air quality, climate, and environmental and human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus will be on the fundamental understanding of atmospheric processes that is needed to interpret and predict climate at both short and long time scales, and on the atmospheric aerosols that are key players that influence these processes. The intellectual merit of this workshop includes the discussion of challenges that exist in understanding the formation of aerosol particles from gaseous precursors and the initial growth of these particles, the internal structure of aerosols, aerosol phase behavior, heterogeneous and multiphase (photo)chemistry, gas-surface interactions, the ability of aerosols to initiate ice and cloud nucleation, the evolution of aerosol optical properties, and the role of bioaerosols in the atmosphere. The workshop will be held at the UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference Center in September, 2020.  NSF support for this meeting will go towards travel for student, postdoctoral, and early career professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  The proposal provided support for the conference A Molecular-Level Understanding of Atmospheric Aerosols (MUOAA 2022), held at the UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference Center, May 15-20, 2022 (originally Sept 20-25, 2020; postponed due to COVID-19). This conference gathered 67 scientists involved in studying atmospherically relevant aerosols in the lab, in the field and via advanced modeling techniques. The objective was to provide molecular level perspectives on complex aerosol properties that are critical to the impact of aerosols on air quality, climate and environmental as well as human health.  Intellectual Merit  A fundamental understanding of atmospheric processes is needed to interpret and predict climate at both short and long-time scales, and atmospheric aerosols are key players that influence these processes. Over the past years it has become evident that some barriers to our molecular level understanding of aerosols can only be addressed through fundamental laboratory, theoretical, and modeling studies in chemistry and physics. For example, challenges exist in understanding the formation of aerosol particles from gaseous precursors and the initial growth of these particles, the internal structure of aerosols, aerosol phase behavior, heterogeneous and multiphase (photo)chemistry, gas-surface interactions, the ability of aerosols to initiate ice and cloud nucleation, the evolution of aerosol optical properties, and the role of bioaerosols in the atmosphere. To address these questions, the symposium brought together an international community of researchers interested in all aspects of the molecular chemistry and physics of aerosols.  It provided a unique forum for the participants, who do not normally meet at conferences related to their specific subfield, to exchange ideas on treating these fundamental, complex, and inherently difficult problems.  The conference convened for 4.5 days with a single session track of invited and contributed talks, as well as posters sessions in the evenings. The emphasis was on longer talks, particularly from people new to the MUOAA community, with an integrated discussion at the end of each session that focuses both on the work presented and on the future directions that are critical to the field. The conference had 9 oral presentation sessions and 4 poster sessions.  Each session had built-in discussion time, with discussion leaders leading the discussion with the whole group.  Session topics included:  Aerosol Physical Chemistry: Advanced, emerging, and novel techniques  Aerosol Physical Chemistry: Health and biological aerosols  Aerosol Physical Chemistry: Chemistry and interfaces I, II, III (3 sessions)  Aerosol Physical Chemistry: Ice nucleation  Aerosol Physical Chemistry: New particle formation, clusters, and nanoparticles  Aerosol Physical Chemistry: Water uptake, glassy systems, phase I, II (2 sessions)  Discussion leaders for each session hosted discussions scheduled at the end of each session.

Several hours of unscheduled time were also available for participants throughout the week to engage in further scientific discussion and enhance the opportunity for developing collaborations. Finally, evening poster sessions offered more time for discussion and interactions, and awards were given to the top student posters.      Broader Impacts  Although the focus of this conference is on atmospherically relevant aerosols, the knowledge exchanged here is directly applicable to industrial processes ranging from the production of pharmaceuticals to maximizing power production in low pressure turbines. The project also provided significant financial support for the travel costs of early career scientists.  Attending the symposium was an enriching experience for all participants, but perhaps particularly for graduate students and post-docs involved in fundamental aerosol research.  The symposium provided a unique opportunity to meet many of the leading, international researchers in the field and to gain exposure to emerging analytical techniques. The significant financial support from the project set aside specifically for travel costs of early career scientists, made it particularly possible for students and post-docs to attend.
