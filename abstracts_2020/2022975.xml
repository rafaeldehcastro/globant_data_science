<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[A critical part of the scientific process is discussing ideas with other scientists to articulate concepts, to make sense of information, and to explain findings and interpretation.  Learning how to participate in this type of discussion, called scientific argumentation, is an important component of STEM education.  Scientific argumentation is included in the definition of scientific literacy established by the National Research Council, which defines "engaging in argument from evidence" as a practice to be incorporated in STEM classrooms.  The goal of this project is to integrate a study of developing skills in scientific argumentation and online learning to examine how to best engage students in scientific argumentation using online discussion boards.  Many undergraduate institutions provide classes online; however, it is unclear how to optimize these virtual classrooms to promote effective argumentation skills.  This project will examine the framing of questions for argumentation and will ask whether questions that more closely align with students' lives and interests promote more fruitful online argumentation.  The project will also examine factors related to student identity (e.g. gender, group dynamics and group inclusivity) in participation in online argumentation, as well as whether participation in online argumentation affects conceptual and/or cognitive development in students.  Findings from the project are expected to contribute to the ongoing analysis of the benefits (or drawbacks) of online STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online discussion boards are used widely and are potentially valuable instructional tools, but little is known about the science learning that occurs via these discussion boards.  This project's goal is to bridge intellectual circles examining scientific argumentation and online learning to provide a greater understanding of how to engage students in scientific argumentation using the asynchronous discussion board.  This project will answer three research questions: (1) to what extent does introductory question-driven discussion affect students' abilities to frame productive scientific argumentation as behavior appropriate to a science classroom? (2) To what extent do group characteristics (e.g. gender) mediate the scientific argumentation behaviors that group members engage in during online and fact-to-face discussions? (3) How much conceptual development occurs when student engage in epistemic versus relational discourse, both in online and face-to-face contexts?  Examining these questions will yield potential solutions to challenges to engaging students in scientific argumentation.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Students who engage in scientific discussions show a greater understanding of scientific concepts, practices, and culture (Asterhan and Schwarz 2007). Engaging students in authentic scientific discourse is a primary goal of science education, but there are many challenges to accomplishing this in the classroom. For example, gender dynamics within student groups may influence how productive scientific discussions (Callis-Duehl et al. 2018). Our study assessed three major components of fostering productive scientific discussions in class &ndash; how does an instructor create a classroom culture of discussion norms that fosters productive discourse; how do group dynamics, such as gender, influence group discussions; and how do the style of instructions provided on activities influence how students engage in discussions. We assessed these topics in both in-person and online pre-pandemic introductory science classes by surveying students about their experiences and either using online discussion transcripts or video transcripts (for in-person classes) to measure aspects of group discussions. Finally, we used a network analysis to look at how in-person group discussions unfolded. We found that students did equally well, if not better when instructors provided students with a list of classroom norms, compared to when the students developed these norms themselves and these results did not vary between in-person or online courses. This is a surprising result, given that most instructional best practices recommend allowing students to engage in the process of developing rules, norms, and other parameters of engagement. Our results seem to indicate that the classroom time and effort to engage students in this process may not lead to additionally productive discussion outcomes. The recommendation is that instructors provide discussion norms to students at the beginning of the semester and have students read and sign these norms acknowledging that they will govern their group interactions. We found that while there were few differences in how students performed in discussions or their overall class performance based on if their group was all female, all male or mixed gendered, there was a significant impact on students in all-male groups, with more of those students dis-engaging from the group discussion and even dropping the course at much higher rates than males in the mixed gender groups or their female peers; these results were consistent across instructional modalities. Our recommendation is that instructors use all mixed gender groups when possible. Finally, we saw that while there were no significant differences between student overall performance and satisfaction regardless of how instructions were presented on class assignments (e.g., instructions could either be cooperative: &ldquo;work with your group to complete this assignment&rdquo; or comparative: &ldquo;when you have completed the assignment, compare your answers with your group&rdquo;), the network analysis does show that the comparative group discussions were much less dynamic with a few group members dominating a relatively short discussion compared to cooperative groups where there was more even participation within groups (see attached figure). Our recommendation is that if an instructor wants students to engage in more discussion, they should use cooperative instructions. Overall, these results will help advise instructors on the best ways to set up their classrooms and activities to provide students opportunities to engage in productive scientific discussions &ndash; a skill that is essential in the modern collaborative science field.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/09/2023<br>      Modified by: Kristine&nbsp;L&nbsp;Callis-Duehl</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
