<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Plant-microbe associations impact plant phenotype, distribution and biodiversity and range in their effects on a spectrum from costly parasitic to beneficial mutualistic interactions. The relationship between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plants is especially important ecologically because these bacteria are able to convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into plant-available ammonia (NH3). The Fellow aims to understand how microbes help plants access nitrogen in extreme soil environments like serpentine soil. These soils are naturally high in heavy metals and low in essential plant nutrients. The project will use a serpentine ecosystem to explore the relative influence of soil chemistry and plant type on beneficial plant-microbe associations and plant development. This research is important because it can help society preserve the biodiversity it knows and loves and improve food production by decreasing reliance on artificial fertilizers. In addition to the research, the Fellow proposes to broaden participation in biology by preparing a diverse STEM workforce and integrating research with education. Specifically, she will continue to mentor undergraduate students and work with communication and digital media experts to create an educational game centered on environmental remediation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore the impact of strong selective soil pressures on microbial local adaptation and mutualism using free-living nitrogen-fixers and non-legumes. Culture-based isolation techniques, qPCR, whole-genome sequencing, and manipulative greenhouse and field surveys will be used to: (1) quantify the abundance of Microvirga spp., a free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria, in serpentine and nonserpentine soils and explore the relative influence of edaphic factors, elevation, and climate on bacterial abundance; (2) identify the presence of ecotypic variation in serpentine- and non-serpentine-isolated Microvirga spp. using functional assays and genome-wide sequencing; and (3) determine the effect of Microvirga spp. on non-leguminous plant survival and development. Through the completion of this project and by working closely with Dr. Michelle Afkhami, students and professors in the Cinema and Interactive Media Department at the University of Miami, the Fellow will: (1) refine her training in microbial ecology; (2) gain skills in whole-genome-sequencing and analysis, (2) further develop her experimental design and analysis skills; (3) begin to understand and apply effective technology, education and research integration practices; and (4) develop as a mentor and mentee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
