<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[For nearly four decades, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has played a leadership role in provisioning advanced cyberinfrastructure capabilities for the Nation's Science and Engineering (S&amp;E) researchers. An important component in this investment is the leadership-class computing program that provides computational and data analytics capabilities at the largest scale to inspire transformative S&amp;E discoveries that would not be possible otherwise. NSF's current leadership-class computing investment supports Frontera, the largest High-Performance Computing (HPC) system on a US academic campus. The Frontera system is deployed and operated by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin. This travel grant will support the participation of researchers who have been awarded a computer time allocation on the Frontera system at a future Principal Investigator (PI) meeting organized by TACC. The award will also support travel for technical coordination between researchers and the Frontera project to ensure optimal and effective utilization of the Frontera system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the PI meeting is to allow Frontera research users, as well as their students, to share scientific results, exchange practical lessons-learned, and present their overall experience from using the Frontera system. In addition to research presentations, the meeting will have ample time, as well as facilitated sessions, to promote increased interaction between Frontera research users and project staff. The outcome of the PI meeting will not only enable the Frontera project to better understand and serve the scientific research community, but also build a community to better represent the unique needs of S&amp;E research that require access to NSF leadership computing facilities. To facilitate deeper coordination beyond the PI meeting, this award will also provide travel support to enable technical coordination between the research user teams and the Frontera project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This supercomputing award studied the role that lipid membranes play in the success or failure of viral infection.  Enveloped viruses such as influenza infect cells by fusing their membrane with a cellular membrane.  The viral proteins that accomplish this task act directly on membranes, but the ways in which they manipulate membranes and the membrane properties that determine the outcome remain incompletely known.  This project performed detailed simulations of influenza virus entry, tracking millions of individual atoms and how they participate in the entry process.  The result was a model for how influenza proteins enact two sequential changes upon host cell membranes to allow viral entry.  This model helps interpret data on influenza viral entry, suggests ways to search for new antiviral inhibitors, and may explain the entry of other viruses also.  In addition to generating this model, the supercomputing project helped test new software for performing many simulations at once and coordinating these simulations.  Such software is critical for automating sophisticated simulations that do not just visualize biology but can quantitatively predict biological mechanisms.  Solving these next-generation simulation problems will enable better understanding of how microscopic-sized biological assemblies interact. This software is freely available and will be applicable to a broad range of science and engineering problems.         Last Modified: 12/22/2021       Submitted by: Peter Kasson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
