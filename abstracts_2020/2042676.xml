<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a new class of smart fire protection blankets (SFPB) to protect citizens and firefighters from wildfires and/or sustaining dangerous exposures to excessive heat.   Wildfires, now more common, can cause death from entrapment, burns, or asphyxiation; these mortalities have increased continuously since 2011.  With the proposed technology, once the firefighter or first responder is exposed to moderate temperatures, the blanket undergoes a phase transformation and begins expanding, generating an air pocket. This reduces the heat flow from the fire to the firefighter’s skin, reducing burn injuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a new class of smart fire protection blankets utilizing shape memory elements. Layers of aluminum foil, fiberglass, Kevlar, fire-retardant sheets and a backing of silica weave will be interwoven with the shape memory elements.  The fast actuation phase transformation characteristics are activated when excessive thermal exposures are detected.  Once activated, the shape memory elements will expand and introduce air pockets inside the blanket that will reduce their thermal conductivity and also lower the risk of burns.  The proposed smart garment will have self-tuning characteristics to adjust the thickness of the air pockets according to the ambient temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Therefore, it is envisioned that the SFPB will have a broad impact on the market of safety devices for protecting citizens and firefighters from the exposures to excessive heat associated with home and wild fires.  The developed technology and commercialization approach lend themselves to be modified and adopted in the development of other critical safety products as the Smart Fire Protection Shelter (SFPS) in the future.  The implementation of the proposed study will involve training of graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of shape control and fire protection. The knowledge gained will be incorporated into the Active Vibration Control course (ENME704) and ENME 808: Advanced Topics in Mechanical Engineering which are taught by the PI at the University of Maryland. These two courses will provide the students with the tools necessary to gain insight about the physics of shape, deflection, and health monitoring of smart structural systems with passive and active networks.   Therefore, a viable alternative to these protective devices is envisioned to be the proposed new class of Smart Fire Protection Blankets (SFPB).  These SFPB are distinguished from the currently available fire blankets by their expandable air layers that are tunable, completely passively, according to the fire conditions and the heat transmission through the blanket.   The SFPB is a natural extension of the smart firefighters’ garment developed by Baz and diMarzo (2019).  Their technology will be modified and adopted in the development of the Smart Fire Protection Blankets (SFPB) as well as the Smart Fire Protection Shelter (SFPS) in the future.  The development will be guided by the fire blankets standards ASTM F-1989-05 (2013).           Last Modified: 06/13/2022       Submitted by: Amr M Baz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
