<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This grant will provide the opportunity for 26 students to attend the American Control Conference where they will attend lectures, present their research, and network with other students, faculty, and professionals in the field. The American Control Conference is internationally recognized as a premier scientific and engineering conference dedicated to the advancement of control theory and practice. The conference brings together an international community of researchers and practitioners to discuss the latest findings in automatic control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2020 ACC technical program will comprise several types of presentations in regular and invited sessions, tutorial sessions, and special sessions along with workshops and exhibits. Controls and the applications considered in this conference (e.g., energy, transportation, manufacturing) span all areas relevant to the National Science Foundation. The project will have a tremendous broader impact in that all the students provided with a travel grant will be diverse (i.e., women, minorities, persons with disabilities, veterans, and first-generation students) and/or from non R1 institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal aimed at supporting a diverse student population to participate in the 2020 American Control Conference (ACC), that was originally planned to be held in Denver, Colorado, July 1-3rd, 2020. The ACC is one of the premier international conferences for scientific and engineering researchers in all areas related to the engineering and science of control systems. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, participants convened virtually to discuss the latest advances in the discipline, to shape its future directions, to provide training and educational opportunities for attendees, and to develop and maintain scientific and professional networks. The range of topics covered at the annual ACC was extremely broad, mirroring the varied applications of control and systems theory. As in the past, the 2020 ACC featured the presentation of contributed and invited papers, tutorial sessions, a late breaking poster session, as well as plenary and semi-plenary sessions and workshops. ACC is the annual conference of the American Automatic Control Council (AACC), the US national member organization of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC). Recognizing the importance of a diverse student population to the present and future of the controls community through AACC, this award provided student registration support for a diverse group of over 100 students to virtually attend this international controls conference.
