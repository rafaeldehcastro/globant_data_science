<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The award to Texas A&amp;M University will support research on a novel lab-on-a-chip system, to determine the identity, functionality, and clonality of antibodies (Abs) elicited by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. One of the most important functions of Abs during viral infection is neutralization, the process whereby Ab binding to viral or host targets prevents viral entry into host cells, thereby thwarting disease. Conventional approaches for determining the functions of pathogen-specific neutralizing Ab (nAb) repertoire are time- and labor-intensive, and thus have only been used to investigate small portions of Ab repertoires. This award will support research to develop a system that enables fast, direct, functional assays that measure viral neutralization activities of Ab-producing cells.  In addition to the strong scientific impact, this award will support cross-disciplinary training postdoctoral, graduate student, and undergraduate student trainees, including women and scientists from historically under-represented groups.  Results from the studies will be disseminated rapidly and in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until recently, the large-scale analysis of antibody repertoires was cost-prohibitive, owing to their massive sizes. However, over the past decade, novel sequencing approaches, including Ig-seq, have provided unprecedented insight into Ab gene repertoires. However, despite these dramatic advances, our understanding of the functions of Ab repertoires remains incomplete.  Support from this award will advance a droplet microfluidics platform termed PRESCIENT, that enables fast, single-cell (digital) resolution, direct, functional assays that measure viral neutralization activities of Ab-producing B-cells, thereby providing a system for rapidly characterizing a large repertoire of nAbs against viral pathogens. The overall objectives are to deliver: A fully integrated microfluidic platform with dual fluorescence detection capability and system level throughput of at least 10 assays/sec achieved; demonstration that sera from inoculated mice react with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen; and characterization (at single cell resolution) the nAb (functional) repertoire against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-GFP. This RAPID award will thus deliver the first global functional characterization of Abs that neutralize pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, a timely response to the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 and an important complement to the ongoing computer simulation studies conducted by other labs. This RAPID award is made by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

We made significant progress in developing and validating the performance of the PRESCIENT microfluidic platform, characterizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen in mice, and propagating viruses required to implement in the experimental system. Also, we have standardized protocols to isolate B cells, the source of antibodies in the system. Concerning the microfluidic development, we optimized the PRESCIENT microfluidic system to help screen the B cells for identifying neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). In the past years, we developed a third generation of the PRESCIENT system and devised the critical path for developing this generation PRESCIENT system to overcome the multiple technical challenges identified in the old system. For example, the current major limitations in the field of droplet microfluidic high-throughput screening systems are the high error rates of critical droplet manipulations, including droplet merging, sorting, and size stability over time. These limitations greatly reduced the type of assays that can be realized in a high-throughput droplet format and have become more prevalent in large library screening applications. To address these limitations, we developed a series of the interdigitated electrode (IDE)-based droplet microfluidic techniques that can handle large numbers of droplets with extremely high accuracy and minimum error. Concerning characterizing antibody responses, we demonstrated that sera from inoculated mice react with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Concerning screening primary B cells, we have shown that B cells can be immortalized for screening, thereby setting the stage for the next phase of development.
