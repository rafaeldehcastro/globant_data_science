<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this innovation is significant.  The US has more than 3 million miles of paved roads.   Roughly 3.5% of the network is repaved annually using a free-floating screed invented in 1930.  In the past 5 years, the paving industry in the US generated an average annual revenue of $25 billion. 3D paving lends itself to many possibilities, including correcting surface problems by applying a thin, variable-thickness lift, integrating color designs and striping, and imbedding objects such as sensors and solar panels in the pavement. If this process leads to a 20% cost reduction (conservative estimate) a cost savings of $5 billion per year could be realized.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project evaluates the feasibility of 3D paving.  There are two main technical challenges: 1) the ability to apply road surface mixtures using a nozzle (This requires engineering the paving mixture as well as the nozzle) and 2) the ability to control the nozzle position in three dimensions, independent of the vehicle frame and road elevation.    The project team will develop mix design parameters to enable nozzle application, a nozzle design to enable paving speed of 20 ft./min., a 3D nozzle control system to apply a surface independent of existing road profile, vehicle requirements, and a commercial feasibility study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project team (SRE and FIU) designed and assembled a prototype for the Autonomous 3-Dimensional Paver (A3DP).&nbsp; The team manufactured certain specialized components and purchased generic hardware and software components. In the course of running this project, the team realized the need to move away from nozzle application to a screw or pnematic application mechanism.&nbsp; The team delivered the prototype as promised in the proposal.&nbsp; In fact, the team added a few enhancements including autonomous motion.&nbsp; The Prototype clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the concept.&nbsp; The team will use the lessons learned from Phase I and the functionality of the prototype to develop and build a functioning, full scale, new and refined version of A3DP. There are three components to this accomplishment, presented below.&nbsp;</p> <h2>1. Development of Asphalt Paving Machine Frame</h2> <p>A 1-inch solid steel frame was manufactured to hold the components and installed on a Landworks - Power Wagon Super Duty, utility service cart wheelbarrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h2>2. Asphalt Compression and Discharge Head</h2> <p>The team designed and manufactured the head which compresses the asphalt and discharges it to the ground.&nbsp; Several polymer screws were designed and manufactured using 3D printers.&nbsp; After the compression effect of various root diameter variation profiles were tested, 2.67 compression ratio was selected. The final screw was designed and manufactured out of 17-4 PH stainless steel by using a Markforged Metal X 3D printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h2>3. Machine Vision and Autonumous Motion</h2> <p>The team worked on generation of 3D geometry by using Delaunay triangulation.&nbsp; The method obtained the data from a point cloud which was obtained from a disparity image.&nbsp; The final version of the autonomous driving system uses an Intel RealSense D455 camera to identify a target and drive the vehicle towards it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>The size of the developed prototype was found ideal for an autonomous asphalt paving machine.&nbsp; It could be carried with a pickup truck and operated by one computer literate technician.&nbsp; The steel frame, attached on the Landworks - Power Wagon Super Duty service cart provided support for all the components including hopper, cylindrical transportation unit and linear tables.&nbsp; SuperDroid Robots 320 Watt 24VDC 120 RPM wheel chair motor pair with an encoder had more than needed torque to move and steer the vehicle.&nbsp; Roseberry pi 4 microcomputer effectively recognized the target and estimated its location from the image of the Intel RealSense D455 camera.&nbsp;</p> <p>Two linear tables were used to create the required motions.&nbsp; One table performed the lateral movement using a stepping motor.&nbsp; The other one was a lifting platform that creates the vertical motion.&nbsp; Both worked well at the tests.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many polymer components of the machine were made using additive manufactring.&nbsp; The parts didn't have any failure at the trail runs.&nbsp;</p> <p>The developed prototype (A3DP) has manual and autonomous operation options.&nbsp; Manual operation mode is used to move the vehicle to the desired location.&nbsp; At the autonomous mode the A3DP drives toward the target automatically.&nbsp; At the manual operation, two front wheels with DC motors are manually raised and the A3DP is driven by the operator.&nbsp; The rear wheels are connected to a geared DC motor that the operator controls manually to move the A3DP forward or backwards.&nbsp; There is one wheel located at the front of the vehicle to allow the operator steer easily.&nbsp; In the autonomous mode, the rear wheels are placed on two-wheel dollies.&nbsp; Two wheels with the DC motors at the front are lowered down to steer and move the vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h2>Future Development</h2> <p>Encouraged by the success of Phase I prototype, the team hopes to work on building a full scale, operational prototype unit to demonstrate its capabilities to the paving industry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Phase II prototype will make significant improvements to current asphalt paving process in the following aspects:</p> <p>a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a compact machine which fits in 4ft X 6ft X 7ft envelope. laying over 1200 pounds of asphalt with a compact machine.&nbsp;</p> <p>c)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;System will operate autonomously.&nbsp; There will not be any workers around the machine when it operates.&nbsp; A3DP should operate day and night with the similar safety margins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce air pollution:&nbsp; A3DP will use only electric motors which are powered by Tesla POWERWALL with 13.5 KWh energy.&nbsp; Internal combustion engines will not be used to avoid releasing exhaust gasses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improve flexibility of operation and reduce road closure:&nbsp; Instead of one large typical asphalt laying machine, multiple small size A3DPs will operate at the worksite.&nbsp;</p> <p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce initial and operating costs:&nbsp; Manufacturing cost of the A3DPs will be drastically low compared to typical asphalt paving machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manufacture unique patterns for speed bumps, rumble strips, aesthetics, or water permeability:&nbsp; Typical asphalt laying machines create a thick solid layer of asphalt block with flat top.&nbsp; Speed bumps, rumble strips, pothole supports are separately built.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/20/2022<br>      Modified by: Hesham&nbsp;Ali</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035768/2035768_10711467_1666237393424_Picture4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035768/2035768_10711467_1666237393424_Picture4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035768/2035768_10711467_1666237393424_Picture4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The designed and manufactured autonomous asphalt laying machine.
