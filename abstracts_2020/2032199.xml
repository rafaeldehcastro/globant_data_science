<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[There is an urgent need to determine structures for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins. CoVs are enveloped viruses, assembled from four major structural proteins: membrane (M), spike (S), and envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N). Researchers supported by this award will focus on the CoV E proteins to understand how the proteins facilitate, through their interactions with cellular membranes, the budding process as the viral genome is enveloped.  The studies will facilitate identification and design of molecules for use in structure-function studies and may structural information that is critical for the design of therapeutics.  Postdoctoral and graduate student trainees, including members from under-represented groups, will be integrally involved in the research effort. Results from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, and made available through shared data repositories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the research supported by this award is to solve atomic structures of CoV E proteins from highly pathogenic human CoVs: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recently emerged SARS-2. CoV E proteins are viroporins - small, hydrophobic integral membrane proteins that oligomerize to form channels that transport physiologically important ions during infection. The proteins are multifunctional, in that they play important roles in virus assembly and pathogenesis.  Studies supported by this award will use of cutting-edge technology approaches for membrane protein structural studies, including heterologous expression systems, crystallization in lipid cubic phase (LCP), and time resolved femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX). The rationale to crystalize in LCP is that the lipids provide a more native-like environment that may facilitate reconstitution of normal oligomeric states of viroporins and in turn, formation of well-diffracting nanocrystals that can be analyzed using X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) capabilities. This RAPID award is made by the Division of Biological Infrastructure using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Future broader impact of the research is insight and structural information that is critical for design and development of therapeutics and vaccines.    We successfully achieved the following outcomes.  1.     Multiple platforms were developed for expression/production of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus E proteins. Crystallization experiments yielded crystals that were analyzed at synchrotron and X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) sources that provided insight for ongoing studies. The expression platforms that were developed provide an important source of protein for further structural and functional studies.  2.     Purified E protein was delivered directly to mammalian cells using a protocol reported previously collaborators. We were able to show further and will report in a future publication that the protein is functional when taken up by cells.  3.     A postdoc and a PhD staff scientist received significant new training that advanced their skills and scientific knowledge. The postdoc is now a staff scientist at a national laboratory. The staff scientist is now working in a biotech translation drug development group. Two summer undergraduate interns expanded their research experience and training while participating in the project. One of the interns presented results at three conferences. The intern is applying to MD/PhD programs. The collective training contributed to expansion of the scientific workforce.  Presentations and interviews about ongoing research, including the CoV E project, during the COVID-19 pandemic provided insight to a broad public audience about the importance of research to address societal needs and challenges          Last Modified: 08/28/2023       Submitted by: Brenda Hogue]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
