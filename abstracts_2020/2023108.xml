<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The oceans play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, currently absorbing approximately one-quarter of the carbon dioxide emissions each year. This carbon is moved from the surface waters to the deep ocean by physical and biological processes. The first is by physical movement, or subduction, of water from the surface to the deep ocean. This is referred to as the solubility pump. The second mechanism, called the biological pump, starts with phytoplankton that take up carbon through photosynthesis in the surface ocean. A small fraction of this material then sinks to the deeper ocean. In a third mechanism, swimming organisms can actively transport material from surface to deeper waters. A current challenge is to understand how all three of these processes interact in smaller patches of the oceans, and to incorporate this knowledge into ocean and climate models. This project will examine these processes using a high-resolution ocean model and comparisons to real-world observations. The project will support early career female scientists, a graduate student, and undergraduate interns. The project will also contribute to the summer Questioning Underlies Effective Science Teaching (QUEST) hands-on program for elementary and middle school teachers, and to a course taught at Princeton University by the lead investigator that uses models developed in her research to teach students how to think critically about ocean and climate models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations show that the ocean carbon pump is modulated by eddies, fronts and filaments, but the integrated effect of these ubiquitous ocean features on the global carbon export is poorly constrained. The proposed effort will harness a high-resolution bio-physical model and existing observations to advance the mechanistic understanding of the biological and physical pumps occurring at small-scale. This project will add to previous works that studied small-scale subduction (from the PI and other groups) and examine how eddy-driven ecosystem patchiness and trophic interactions influence the subduction and sinking pumps (Objective 1). The project will also bring new mechanistic insights in the migration pump (Objective 2). Specifically, how eddy effects modulate the interplay between mesozooplankton abundance, grazing and diurnal migration amplitude. This project excludes the effects of migrations on seasonal scales, larger mesopelagic animals, and some biological factors (e.g. body-size). Yet it will provide a much-needed baseline for future work to explore this pump in more realistic cases, such as the interpretation of high resolution in-situ measurements and the analysis of global model results. This project will also provide, for the first time, a synthesis of the ocean carbon pumps response to small-scale dynamics in a regional framework over a full seasonal cycle (Objective 3). This project will use an idealized double gyre model but the contrasted regions will give a broad perspective, relevant to the understanding of the global ocean carbon pump and how it might respond to climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
