<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Democracies serve heterogeneous constituents, expressing significant variation in social and cultural factors. To ensure peaceful coexistence between different social actors, reaching and preserving consensus is a priority for democratic governments. Although consensus may be pursued on virtually any issue, resource management is a frequent target of democratic policy making, with different implications for different stakeholders. This doctoral dissertation research examines how different social groups—rural communities, urban state bureaucrats, and corporate officials—attempt to reach agreements on complex issues arising from variation in approaches to resource management. Examining how and under what conditions consensus may be reached in a diverse society is essential to understanding how different peoples holding varied worldviews, modes of living, and means of self-expression co-exist. The project supports the training of a U.S.-based graduate student and findings will be broadly disseminated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will investigate the strategies and narratives employed by culturally distinct groups in pursuit of consensus over resource management policies in a context where officials are making a concerted effort to establish peaceful spaces of deliberation. By bringing together rural and Indigenous leaders, government officials, and company representatives, these spaces of deliberation are an ideal site for examining how different social actors pursue agreement with one another. This research combines in-person and digital qualitative methods to document and analyze the spaces of deliberation in which people from radically different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds endeavor to reach agreements with one another. Through interviews with rural community leaders, residents, and government bureaucrats, the doctoral student will investigate whether and how cultural and socioeconomic differences shape political communication and how consensus is pursued on divisive questions of resource distribution.  Findings from this research will illuminate the spectrum of strategies—from deliberation to social protest—that different groups deploy in pursuit of shared political ground while contributing to social science theories about the role consensus plays in democratic politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Adela Zhang has completed research for her dissertation "Conflicts of Coexistence: Social Protest, Consensus, and Multicultural Democracy in Peru" with support from the NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant. During her funding period, she spent 12 months with peasant communities involved in persistent social conflicts over mining activity in the Peruvian Andes. As a political anthropologist, Zhang was interested in understanding how democratic conflict resolution policies, called dialogue, shape resource disputes. She was specifically focused on the relationship between deliberation and consensus in multicultural contexts.  As a participant observer of dialogue roundtables, Zhang accomplished the goal of collecting data about how culturally distinct groups&mdash;indigenous communities, government bureaucrats, and company representatives&mdash;engage one another in spaces of deliberation. She worked with community leaders and state officials to understand how they communicate with one another and how they understand consensus. Community leaders were committed to renegotiating the current conditions of extractive activity while government officials were invested in ensuring that mining activity could continue and hoped to obtain win-win outcomes for all involved parties. The data collected is the basis for her dissertation about the limits on and possibilities for democratic politics under conditions of serious inequality.   Her dissertation will address the multiple dilemmas facing liberal democratic governments everywhere. Is deliberation the best way to achieve agreement? Is agreement necessary for a just society? The observations made indicate that deliberation may not always be the best way to create consensus and, moreover, that consensus is not always just or fair for all people, particularly in places marked by extreme social and economic inequality.
