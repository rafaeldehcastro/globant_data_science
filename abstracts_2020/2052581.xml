<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project offers a unique opportunity to advance our fundamental understanding of hydrologic and geomorphic processes following wildfire events. The project will provide public access to perishable data with a wide range of potential applications for stakeholders in many fields, including hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, geotechnical engineering, and natural hazards management. The team will collect a variety of data including: post-fire near-surface soil moisture, electric conductivity, soil temperature and CO2 flux after wildfire events in nearby burned and unburned areas; soil samples using in-situ geotechnical sampling and tests to understand geotechnical characteristics of burned and unburned soils (e.g., soil texture, hydraulic properties, shear strength and compressibility); soil texture, land cover change and vegetation change information from drone images and aerial photos. The project will provide training to a graduate student in data collection. The lead university is a minority serving institution. The principal investigators frequently recruit minority undergraduate students. The data collected in this project will be used for future undergraduate research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wildfires greatly change the land cover of hydrologic basins, increasing the overland flow and debris movement, and oftentimes decreasing the basinâ€™s time of concentration. Wildfires can also adversely impact geotechnical characteristics (e.g., index, mechanical, hydraulic properties) of the near-surface soil in burned areas, which may result in reduced soil stability and increased likelihood of post-wildfire landslides, mud and debris flows, erosion, and excessive runoff. Floods and debris flows pose a significant threat, especially when extreme precipitation falls over burned areas (e.g., the 2018 debris flow in Montecito, California). This is an example of a compound event in which two consecutive events lead to extreme societal impacts. In this project, the investigators will collect perishable post-fire data with a focus on changes in soil characteristics in burned areas. This data could be useful for analyses on compound geohazards associated with wildfires, including landslide and debris flow analysis and land-surface dynamics. This award is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
