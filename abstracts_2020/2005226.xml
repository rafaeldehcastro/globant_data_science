<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Steven Gaines at University of California Santa Barbara, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating regulatory compliance in natural resource management. Noncompliance and rule breaking can threaten the effectiveness of resource governance and the sustainability of their associated resource systems. In the world’s oceans for example, illegal fishing is considered one of the greatest threats to marine ecosystems. Political science theory predicts that self-governance (regulations devised and enacted by resource users themselves) leads to high levels of compliance compared to “top-down” regulations imposed by governments. However, this has never been empirically examined at a large scale. This project tests whether self-governance increases regulatory compliance with marine protected areas, a widespread tool for fisheries management, through the analysis of a large dataset collected by a partner organization, Rare. In addition to the training of an early-career scientist, this award advances the fundamental behavioral and political science of compliance, and has the potential to advance global fisheries equity and sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a multidimensional model of regulatory compliance to compare compliance types and extent under different governance arrangements, and contributes primarily to common-pool resource theory, a theory of collective action for natural resource management. Predictions based on either legitimacy or rational-choice models have not been able to explain or predict compliance in natural resource management, such as in the case of fisheries. A new multidimensional model of compliance (“motivational postures model”) from social-ecological theory has recently been proposed to understand compliance with state-implemented regulations, which we use to compare the extent and type of compliance under self-governance and top-down governance arrangements. This project uses a large dataset collected by Rare for their Fish Forever program, with quantitative and qualitative data on noncompliance in hundreds of sites where no-take marine protected areas (areas where fishing is banned) have been implemented, along with gear restrictions and other fishing regulations. Analysis of this large dataset will be complemented by original mini-ethnographic case studies of several select sites. This project challenges binary conceptualizations of compliance, instead using a framework that engages with resistance, power, and equity. This project contributes to fundamental research on human behavior around co-managed resources, with broader implications for resource sustainability and legitimacy of institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The most prominent and intensely studied strategy to manage near-shore fisheries spatially has been to implement permanent bans on fishing in marine protected areas (MPAs). However, the effectiveness of marine protected areas at sustaining fish stocks is mediated by compliance by fishers. Traditionally, marine protected areas implemented by governments ("top-down" MPAs) lead to low compliance. An outstanding question is whether fishers' involvement in designing and enforcing fisheries closures (i.e., through community-designed protected areas, an example of a "bottom-up" MPA) leads to improved compliance. Attempts to empirically answer this question are muddied by a binary understanding of compliance, where compliance is characterized as either 'follow rule' or 'don't follow rule' - which matches poorly on to the realities of small-scale fishers' behavior.&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The main goal of this project was to compare regulatory compliance between marine protected areas with top-down and bottom-up governance. To do this, we developed a new method to evaluate compliance and then applied the new method to test the assumption of common-pool resource theory that bottom-up governance leads to higher compliance. The method we developed took existing survey data from fishing households collected by our partner organization, Rare, and generated two-dimensional patterns of compliance attitudes. This method identified four clusters of compliance 'types' in Rare's dataset of over 4000 fishing households from seven countries (Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil, Micronesia, Palau, Honduras, Mozambique). We labeled these four types of compliance: committed, supportive, ambivalent, and resistant. We then compared the relative prevalence of these types between places with 'bottom-up' or community-based fisheries management, and areas with 'top-down' or government-led fisheries management, as well as in areas with "co-management", where power is shared between resource users and the government. We found support for the assumption that bottom-up governance leads to compliance attitudes associated with greater compliance, and found that this relationship was stronger when comparing <em>de facto</em> governance in practice than in comparing areas by their legal governance arrangement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual merit</strong>: This project advanced the fundamental science of behavioral economics and political science by describing a new typology of regulatory compliance applicable to both self-governance and traditional, top-down governance. This typology included the usual suspects: the "committed" type that actively supports and enforces the rules and the "resistant" type that is opposed to the rules and does not participate in rule-making. However, we also found two types that warrant further study: the "supportive" type who agree with the rules but do not participate in rule-making or enforcement, and the "ambivalent" type who agree with the principles of the rules (specifically, that they are fair and represent their interests) but who do not think the rules actually lead to societal benefits. In addition to this advancement of theory, this project developed a methodology for identifying compliance types that could be tailored to compliance in other contexts such as medical (for example, voluntary compliance with COVID-19 mask recommendations) or defense (for example, compliance with safety regulations).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts</strong>: The scientific advances that this project made in regulatory compliance could have widespread applications to diagnosing the types of compliance present under different types of rule environments. This project could particularly advance our understanding of compliance from a more nuanced perspective with voluntary and bottom-up regulatory environments.
