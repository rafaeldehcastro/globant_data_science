We are going to solve a problem, we have a dataset which comprises several paper abstracts, one per file, that were furnished by the NSF (National Science Foundation). A sample abstracts are attached in .xml files. The task is developing an unsupervised model which classifies abstracts into a topic (discover them!). Indeed, the goal is to group abstracts based on their semantic similarity.

We can have some examples of abstracts in the attached files (.xml). Be creative and state clearly your approach. Although we don’t expect accurate results but a good pipeline of your work. It is affordable to create a notebook, like Jupyter (if you use python) or a Rmarkdown report (in case you use R) and make it available for us, i.e. github.

Hint to success in your quest: Develop and stay clear of the data science process you'll perform over the dataset and highlight important aspects you might consider affordable to discuss over.

Aside notes: All fields in every abstract file wouldn’t be needed. Be keen. Good luck and have fun.

I'll work it on Python, so you'll do python code

First give me a .md file with the data science process we'll perform over the dataset and highlight important aspects which are affordable to discuss over. Then I will tell you the next steps to follow.
