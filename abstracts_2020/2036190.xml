<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this small business innovation research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will be to revolutionize the lives of the millions of patients currently using multiple urinary catheters per day due to severe bladder dysfunctions from nervous system damage.  The current standard of care is associated with a poor quality of life and frequent hospitalizations due to life-threatening infections linked to the sensory issues of this population.  The proposed project restores these patients' ability to sense, enabling a significant decrease in mortality and costs (~$12B/yr).  The proposed technology will allow these patients normal relief and fewer hospitalizations by using an app enabled with artificial intelligence (AI).    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a wireless communication circuit and downstream AI algorithms to advise patients of the need for relief, and alerting both patients and clinicials to the presence of a urinary tract infection in real time to enable an early intervention. In addition, the technology is directly applicable to all urinary catheters used in the hospital setting, where they are a major source of costs and mortality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Over 3 million people in the US have neurological based bladder dysfunctions.  Currently the standard of care is for them to self catheterize themselves 5-8x times a day at a set schedule.  This process leads to a severe reduction in quality of life, is disruptive of normal daily life, and frequently leads to costly hospitalizations from urinary tract infections.  Furthermore, the WHO estimates that over 200 million people in the world have some form of bladder dysfunction, and all of the standard catheter based devices we have available currently have similar issues with quality of life and urinary tract infections.  Starling Medical is developing the UrinControl System to significantly improve the quality of life of NGB patients by freeing them from the frequent burdens of clean intermittent catheterization. The connected urinary catheter-like prosthesis enables the Al-powered remote monitoring of patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction to monitor for the early signs of Urosepsis and to enable remote Urodynamics screenings of patients through our telehealth portal. In addition, our monthly replaced implant enables our patients to void their bladders at the push of a button as a replacement to the practice of intermittent catheterization reducing the number of monthly catheter insertions from ~180 to just 1.   The device utilizes a wirelessly-driven pumping mechanism to allow for normal use of a toilet on the user’s command. It has an internal fail-safe valve to ensure that the bladder never over pressurizes, a mechanism for bacterial detection, and is equipped with novel RF-powered circuitry. The embedded smart sensors allow the patient to check how full his or her bladder is, and uses machine learning to identify signs of a building infection before the patient presents with symptoms. As this happens, the user is able to relay their real-time health information directly to their healthcare provider using their smartphone. The user can then receive any necessary treatment or prophylaxis before severe disease develops. The UrinControl device essentially fills in any gaps in the user's own real-time understanding of their urological health and vastly improves the accessibility of care.   During this phase 1 grant, the Intellectual Merit we accomplished can be summarized as:  Demonstration of our novel miniaturized RF-powered wireless communication circuitry to be able to generate enough power to power our downstream circuitry.   Demonstrated our novel embedded spectroscopy-based sensor’s ability to be sensitive to multiple components relevant to urinary tract infections Demonstrated our base AI model to be able to differentiate between a symptomatic hospital bound urinary tract infection from control urine from neurogenic bladder patients with complex colonized bladders Enabled the training of a diverse array of 2 FTE engineers and 6 interns    Broader Impact  The broader impact of this work reprents a fundamental change in the lives of millions of people dealing with this diabilitiating urlogical condition.  For many of them, there is no cure for their bladder dysfunction requiring life long catheterization and the health issues that come along with it.  The work in this grants gets us closer to being able to give these patients a better option to be able to pee more simply and safer on a day to day basis.  The AI work completed in this grant is unprecedented in its ability to potentially diagnose these patients infections earlier and more acurately than ever before which can potentially prevent the currently required hospitilization for their treatment.  Thereby, improving costs for payors and outcomes for patients.         Last Modified: 08/25/2022       Submitted by: Alex Arevalos]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
