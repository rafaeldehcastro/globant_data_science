<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project impacts the ability of drug developers, translational investigators, and basic scientists to track proteins in living cells. Current approaches are time-consuming, labor-intensive and low-throughput. Investing in these approaches is therefore relatively high-risk for most investigators and are most often employed only for proteins with well-defined functions. This technology represents a rapid and scalable method for protein labeling, allowing investigators to include a broader range of proteins of interest (POIs) in a given study. By reducing the initial investment required, both academic and industry investigators are likely to expand the POIs included in a given study. Our expectation is that the scalability and flexibility of this method will accelerate drug screening and development activities, revealing more promising lead candidates. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance translation of the homology-independent universal genome engineering (HiUGE) method, developed as a means of evaluating a broad range of proteins in neural function and development. This project advances research in developing a number of functional knock-in vectors, allowing fluorescent proteins labeling (FluorTag), functional disruption (DisrupTag), and downstream protein purification (MassTag). Pairing these vectors with the genome-wide library under development during this project will allow the company to rapidly provide cell lines expressing proteins of interest with customized modifications, all under endogenous promoter control. The specific goal of this project is to develop a scalable, high-throughput screening platform using the technology to label every protein encoded by the human genome. Technical tasks include: identify gene specific-gRNA sequences for all coding regions, searching and prioritizing insertion sites both at the N- and C-terminal regions of all proteins using defined criteria; develop a pilot scale screening library, comprising cells with HiUGE insertion sites in 96 genes of interest; apply new automation resources to scale for all 20,000 protein-encoding genes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CasTag Biosciences has been diligently focused on developing novel CRISPR knock-in research reagents on the path to generating a whole genome arrayed library to facilitate experimental goals in both basic biology and drug development.  Our homology independent universal genome engineering (HiUGE) technology was developed in response to a lack of antibodies and inability to use homology directed repair for CRISPR knock-in editing for neuroscience research applications in non-dividing cells, and CasTag was launched to broaden that mission beyond the neuroscience research community.  The NSF Phase I SBIR grant has allowed us to focus on the primary technical objectives of identifying GS-gRNA sequences for all protein coding genes in the human genome and evaluating feasibility of whole-genome targeting of endogenous proteins by developing a pilot-scale library.  As we began further market research during the NSF bootcamp, our discussions led us to identify a list of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) for priority reagent development and we focused on them as targets during our proof-of-concept work.  Given GPCRs are popular targets for drug development, existing antibodies for studying GPCRs are notoriously unreliable, and much of the field relies on overexpression cell lines for target binding studies that lack biological relevance, we knew it was worth targeting this difficult protein family despite their low endogenous expression levels.   Through completing our Phase I grant work, CasTag has proven the ability to design gRNAs at scale for utilization alongside our HiUGE donor technology, and facilitate a variety of research applications across the genome with improved product performance.  We demonstrated our gRNA design and validation strategy for whole genome HiUGE reagent development, and developed an initial library of HiUGE labeling reagents for GPCRs.  This process can be easily scaled to target the entire GPCR-ome and/or other protein families, and also be deployed in the form of knock-in cell lines instead of the traditional research reagent.  Continued efforts to expand the platform via partnerships and collaborators are imperative to completing the mission of generating a whole genome knock-in arrayed library.
