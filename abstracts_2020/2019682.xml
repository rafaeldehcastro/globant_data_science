<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) addresses research issues in designing, building, managing, and evaluating advanced data-intensive systems and applications. It is a leading forum for researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The 36th ICDE will be held in Dallas Texas, April 20-24, 2020. This award enables diverse US students to participate in ICDE-2020, provides opportunities to the students to interact with other attendees and attend the educational events being offered. The students' participation in ICDE-2020 is important to the students research training and will develop the future generation of leaders and workforce in the increasingly critical data management field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supported students will have opportunities to showcase their research results, learn about the cutting edge research conducted by others, and interact with experts at a premier data engineering conference. ICDE-2020 includes a comprehensive program including research papers presentations, tutorials, panels, industrial papers, and technical demonstrations that provide a platform for exchange of research results and ideas, interaction and education. The program also includes workshops that demand dedicated coverage due to their relevance to the current data management research and development, industrial exhibits, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. The students will also have an opportunity to participate in a PhD Symposium, which provides a forum for PhD students to present their research ideas, and interact with and receive feedback from senior members of the research community in academia and industry. The focus of the PhD Symposium is on mentorship and providing constructive feedback to the students. These opportunities will have a long lasting impact on the future career of the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Therefore, we had discussions with the program manager for alternate activities.    We have prepared research material on Data Science for Social Good and presented them at relevant data science-related conferences as well as at various Instiutions.  Specifically, what we did with the funds was to develop a research-based tutorial/seminar on  Data Science for Good and presented this tutorial at various Data Science venues in 2022 and 2023.   We presented this seminar to several on-line events and webinars around the world, and especially focus on presenting this work to various Institutions in the USA and also developing countries especially in Africa.

We presented this seminar to several on-line events and webinars around the world, and especially focus on presenting this work to Minority Serving Institutions in the USA and also developing countries especially in Africa.   The content of the research tutorials/seminars would include the following:  (sample).  1.      Big Data Analytics for Political Science/Social Science    2.      Blockchain Applications and Security for Social Good  3.       Semi-supervised Learning, Promises, and Its Applications towards Social Good          Last Modified: 04/24/2023       Submitted by: Latifur R Khan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
