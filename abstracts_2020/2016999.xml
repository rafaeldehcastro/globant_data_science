<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project investigates violence against women among marginalized women through an examination of the impacts of a series of recent policy reforms. It asks what legal and other support mechanisms are most likely accessed, utilized, and engaged with when violence against women proves to be systemic and resistant to reform. This mixed-methods study provides an opportunity to assess the everyday ways in which marginalized women experience violence and negotiate its after-effects, which is essential to evaluating the possibilities and limitations of top-down policy models. In addition to supporting the training of graduate and undergraduate student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, findings from this research will be widely disseminated, with practical implications for stakeholders, policymakers, and social scientists, as well as concrete policy recommendations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine why, despite the implementation of sweeping policy reforms, increasingly high rates of violence against women continue to exist in marginalized communities and will explore what variables contribute to systemic threats of violence.  This analytically rich case will permit the researcher to work with a range of local governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, including social service and legal professionals, state level bureaucrats, as well as marginalized survivors and community stakeholders to determine the relationship between policy, community anti-violence initiatives, and legal outcomes among marginalized women. Data will be collected using ethnographic methods, long-term participant observation, semi-structured and life-history interviews, social media analysis, and urban social mapping. The results of the research will contribute new insight into the specific sociocultural, economic, and geopolitical conditions that both undergird and restrict advances towards effective, equitable reforms. In addition, this research will enhance theories of violence, vulnerability, and gendered citizenship, furthering social scientific understandings of how marginalized communities' manifest resilience and organize in contexts of recurring violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this research was to examine gender-based violence (GBV) and access to justice and care among low-income women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Specifically, this research set out to evaluate the local impacts of Brazil's post-dictatorship effort to "engender" state institutions through the creation of gender-specialized state services--including women's police stations, specialized courts, shelters, and women's centers. Through multi-sited urban ethnography, this research sheds light on violence and precarity, gendered citizenship, and women's social movements, issues of continuing relevance in anthropology.  Intellectual Merit  The final project built upon previous research on gender-based violence and the politics of engendering the state in two ways. First, GBV had mainly been studied through two approaches: 1) as a sequence of (in)direct causes and effects and/or 2) through analyses of acts of violence themselves. Together these approaches reflect a tendency to fix GBV to a linear timeline, as a series of events with a before, during, and after. This project shifted the frame of analysis to focus on the continuities of GBV and how low-income women address this ongoing issue in their communities. Second, this project expanded anthropological knowledge of the concrete impacts of engendering the state on local communities. This project is rooted in the idea that local knowledge, gleaned from people's everyday lived experiences of GBV policy, is a rich source of insight that can be applied not only by GBV policy-makers and legislators, but also to enrich our theoretical frameworks of violence itself.  Broader Impacts  In Brazil, violence against women is often normalized and met with impunity. This research intervened in this cycle by enabling the following broader impacts. First, this research was driven by a concrete need to understand the efficacy of GBV policy in Brazil such that it can be further refined. The results of this research bear on future policy related to GBV, as they fundamentally evidence how policy-makers need be more attuned to local stakeholder subjectivities (especially those of marginalized women) and account for the power dynamics that shape dominant narratives of and responses to GBV as they propose and draft policy. Second, this research promoted learning and strengthened research capacity in Brazil, as it was conducted in collaboration with four emergent Brazilian scholars: two in archival sciences and two in social sciences. The collaborators of this work will undoubtedly continue to advance the scientific endeavor in Brazil, a country that has struggled in recent years with limited funding and support for the sciences.  Research Findings  Through remote and in-country ethnographic research with the people who both administer services and utilize them, this research produced the following specific takeaways:  1) Gender-specialized services represent a crucial intervention in social services for women experiencing domestic violence in Brazil. Prior to the Maria da Penha Law, Brazil's world-renowned domestic violence legislation passed in 2006, women experienced many barriers to accessing rights related to justice and care from the state. Gender-specialized services, thus, signal a departure from this history of dismissing and decriminalizing GBV.  2) The visibility of the Maria da Penha Law and gender-specialized services has rendered them vulnerable in conservative political contexts.
