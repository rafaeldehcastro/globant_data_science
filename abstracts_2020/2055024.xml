<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[There is a well-documented lack of diversity in the geoscience classroom, faculty and geoscience professional ranks and environmental workforce. This workshop introduces a diverse population of high school and undergraduate participants to solution based geoscience and potential career pathways. The workshop will help increase the diversity in the educational and career pipeline of future geoscience professionals and show participants ways to become active in addressing the impact of public facilities on their communities. Working with practicing geoscientists and educators, participants will develop and present on cutting edge environmental infrastructure (water, power, sewer, solid waste, etc.) issues, technologies and careers which affect their daily lives. They will learn the skill sets necessary to become more active participants and problem solvers who are focused on using geoscience to aredress the impact of public facilities on their communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop has the potential to increase participants’ awareness of environmental infrastructure and the connection to community impacts and STEM-related careers. The proposed workshop squarely addresses AGU’s Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan including to 1) “Promote and expand collaborative activities... with local community–relevant scientific endeavors, particularly in support of under-served and disadvantaged communities” and 2) “Increase the visibility of education and career paths (in earth science) among diverse audiences and encourage participation in the geosciences.” Program participants will develop creative content for presentation at the 2020 AGU Virtual Fall Meeting - including virtual tours, videos, and interactive communication pieces to demonstrate how New Orleans', San Francisco’s and Los Angeles' unique geology and seaport locations impact the critical infrastructure of those cities and respective communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Geoscience Behind Critical Infrastructure Careers; Unlocking the Intrinsic Value of Diverse Communities - a GEO-STEM Learning Ecosystem in Practice project was designed to increase the awareness of and diversity in Geology, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematical (Geo-STEM) related infrastructure careers.  Currently, there is a distinct lack of diversity in Geo-STEM education and careers.  This project advanced the knowledge of Geo-STEM infrastructure education and careers by engaging high school students, college students, and early professionals in a virtual internship program.  Through this internship, participants researched local infrastructure facilities, talked to working professionals about their careers and prepared a presentation to be given at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall 2020 meeting.  The presentation illustrated the information gathered by interns regarding each facility, the jobs needed to provide, operate, and manage each infrastructure facility, the education/training needed for those jobs, and the salary range for each critical position.   Another aspect of this project was to further develop this platform so other professional associations can use it to engage local underrepresented communities in their conferences.  This project provides a way for professional societies to work with local community organizations and increase diversity within the workforce pool.  As a result of this project, Arizona State University (ASU) was awarded a much larger grant from the NSF to continue to develop this type of programming.  ASU has continued to work with AGU and is looking for other professional associations who are interested in adding this type of education experience to their conferences.    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
