<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. David C. Bolton has been awarded an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to investigate the evolution of earthquake foreshock sequences in time and space, explored through natural and laboratory fault zones. Estimating the timing and location of future earthquakes has been a long-standing goal in the study of seismology. However, progress in this area has been slow due to a poor understanding of the connections between the origins of earthquakes and seismic activity. Foreshocks are small earthquakes that precede the main earthquake and are thought to be indirect evidence that a fault is close to failure. However, foreshocks are not an easily observed feature of all earthquakes, and their connection to the impending earthquake is not well understood. This work will integrate laboratory and field-based observations of foreshocks with an aim to provide a coherent understanding of the evolution of foreshock sequences. A significant focus will be devoted to investigating whether foreshock properties encode information about the mainshock size. This work will provide key insights into the preparatory phase of earthquakes and will help advance earthquake early warning systems and improve earthquake hazard assessment.  The project will also join forces with the GeoFORCE outreach program led by the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT-Austin to provide research opportunities to underrepresented communities in southwest Texas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement novel machine learning and earthquake seismology techniques for developing high-fidelity earthquake catalogs that are rich in small magnitude events. These high-resolution catalogs will illuminate how foreshocks interact with each other, their evolution in space and time, and their connection to the mainshock. The project will utilize laboratory experiments instrumented with acoustic emission monitoring to shed light on the causative processes that drive foreshock sequences. Fault zone properties such as stress, slip displacement, strain, will be integrated with the spatio-temporal patterns of acoustic emissions, allowing for a detailed understanding of the connection between the physics of earthquake nucleation processes and seismic activity. A second key element of the project will involve scaling up the laboratory observations to geologically relevant conditions by detecting and locating foreshocks on the well-characterized and seismically active Apennine fault system in Italy. This multi-scale, integrated research plan represents a unique opportunity to study seismic processes from the laboratory to tectonic scale and will determine if characteristics of laboratory foreshocks can be scaled up to tectonic fault zones. The proposed work has important implications for seismic hazard analysis and could help improve our ability to make accurate hazard forecasts and scientific predictions about earthquake processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Earthquakes pose a significant risk to communities around the globe, particularly those in coastal regions that suffer from the combined effects of intense ground shaking and tsunamis. Earthquake prediction and forecasting has been at the forefront of earthquake science for well-over century, but progress in this area has been slow. A key component for advancing earthquake forecasting and earthquake early warning systems is understanding how earthquakes get started and whether the early stages of an earthquake (i.e., the nucleation stage) broadcasts information in a manner that could foretell an impending earthquake. Foreshocks, which are small earthquakes that precede the main-shock, are thought to be an indicator of imminent failure. Thus, understanding the characteristics and physical processes that modulate foreshock properties could provide insights into how earthquakes get started and help transform earthquake early warning systems and forecasting. In this work, we integrate fault zone measurements with seismic data from laboratory friction experiments and probe the relationship between foreshocks and nucleation processes.</p> <p>We conducted a suite of laboratory experiments that spanned a spectrum of slip modes, ranging from slow to fast co-seismic slip rates. We investigated the nucleation process and foreshock properties of slow and fast laboratory earthquakes by measuring fault zone properties, such as stress, displacement, and fault slip velocity in tandem with high-resolution seismic data throughout 500+ laboratory earthquakes. We developed acoustic emission (AE) catalogs, consisting of over 1-million events and measured waveform similarity of AE templates. We focused our analysis on waveform similarity measurements because they provide key insights into AE source properties and source locations. Slow/small earthquakes are preceded by a modest increase in waveform similarity, whereas fast/large laboratory earthquakes are preceded by late and rapid increase in waveform similarity. Furthermore, differential travel-times suggests that foreshocks coalesce in space and time prior to fast laboratory earthquakes. Both the AE data and fault zone measurements show distinct differences between the nucleation process of slow and fast laboratory earthquakes. During the inter-seismic period of slow slip, the fault never locks up and lacks a distinct nucleation phase, which explains the modest increase in waveform similarity prior to slow lab earthquakes. In contrast, during fast laboratory earthquakes the fault completely locks up during the inter-seismic period and unlocks abruptly immediately before failure causing the late/rapid increase in waveform similarity. In summary, the laboratory earthquakes studied here are preceded by a slow nucleation process driven by pre-seismic fault slip, which in turn, can be imaged via waveform similarity measurements. Our results are in good agreement with theoretical models of earthquake nucleation and provide further evidence that foreshocks are a byproduct of a slow nucleation process. This work is currently in review at Nature Communications.</p> <p>Funding from this project helped support work regarding the spectral properties of slow and fast laboratory earthquakes. In this work, we were able to demonstrate that both slow and fast laboratory earthquakes radiate high-frequency energy well beyond their geodetic corner frequency. Broadly speaking, this study highlights the importance of having measurements close to the fault zone for documenting seismic radiation properties. This work was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research in the spring of 2022.</p> <p>Furthermore, funding from this project has helped develop a new 1 meter direct shear machine that will be housed at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics. This machine will help address a broad range of questions regarding foreshocks, fault zone heterogeneity, earthquake nucleation, rupture, and termination. Answers to these questions will build off work supported by this project and will serve as a stepping stone to scaling up laboratory experiments to the field scale.</p> <p>Finally, during the summer of 2022 the PI joined forces with the Undergraduate Research Traineeship Experience (RTX) program at UT Austin?s Jackson School of Geosciences. RTX is a program designed for STEM undergraduates to engage in geoscience research while honing their technical, education, professional skills. Through the RTX program, the PI mentored a undergraduate student from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on a interdisciplinary project that integrated seismology, rock mechanics, and machine learning (ML). The student worked closely with the PI and gained a broad range of skillsets in programing, earthquake science, and ML. The student successfully trained a ML model (i.e., PhaseNet) to predict arrival times of laboratory seismicity. The PI is building off this work by using ML techniques to develop high-resolution earthquake catalogs for laboratory seismicity. These high-resolution catalogs produced by ML techniques will enhance our understanding of earthquake processes and will help foster future research endeavors.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/08/2022<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;C&nbsp;Bolton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2050006/2050006_10750097_1662674550614_Fig3_Final--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2050006/2050006_10750097_1662674550614_Fig3_Final--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Maximum cross-correlation coefficient as a function of stress state"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2050006/2050006_10750097_1662674550614_Fig3_Final--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Maximum cross-correlation coefficient as a function of stress state"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Maximum cross-correlation coefficient versus percent of peak stress reached prior to co-seismic failure.
