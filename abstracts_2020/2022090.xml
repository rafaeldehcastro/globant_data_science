<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Major Research Instrumentation award allows the acquisition of a focused ion beam integrated with a scanning electron microscope at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC). This instrument will aid UDC, a historically black college and university, in its goal to transform into an effective urban research institution serving a diverse student population. The instrument can produce high resolution images with nanoscale resolution of surfaces, cross-sections and three-dimensional structures. Characterization and analysis at the nanoscale will promote and benefit faculty and student research in the cutting-edge research fields of national needs. The instrument will enable multidisciplinary research at UDC into a wide range of fields. These include magnetic devices for control systems, solar cell for energy harvesting, nanomaterials and nanodevices for thermal management and energy systems, soil improvement for hazard mitigation, and water resources recovery techniques for sustainability. This instrument will be a key component of UDC’s research infrastructure. The instrument will also play a critical role in the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students from a broad spectrum of STEM disciplines. The activities enabled by the instrument will enrich students’ educational experience and provide rewarding research training. The instrument will foster partnerships with surrounding universities and community colleges to provide experiential learning to students. Educational resources on microscopy will be disseminated through workshops and engineering open houses to teachers and high school students. These activities will introduce of K-12 students to the fundamental concepts and techniques of microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dual Beam Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM/FIB) delivers superior performance to analyze three-dimensional structural characterization and compositional information of engineered and natural materials at nano-scale resolution. The FIB uses the milling function to create cross section inside the material that illustrates its internal structure at the nano-scale. The FIB/SEM complements the existing nanotechnology and characterization resources at UDC and provides much-needed capabilities in the areas of high-resolution imaging, depth profiling and 3D reconstruction, and chemical spectroscopy at the nanoscale to catalyze new scientific discoveries. It will serve as an indispensable tool for research that will create and enhance (i) understanding and fabrication of novel, direct-write nanofluidic structures; (ii) knowledge about the effect of ferromagnetic (FM) electrode composition on magnetic and transport properties of magnetic tunnel junction based molecular spintronics devices (MTJMSDs); (iii) fundamental understanding of the energetics of phase change inside self-assembled nano-micelle-based materials; (iv) understanding the correlation between nanowire microstructure and fabrication conditions as well as the resulting photovoltaic performance; (v) understanding of the nano-micro mechanisms of microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) and other mineral precipitation processes and their effects on the macro mechanical properties of sand and silty soils; and (vi) knowledge about the prevention of uncontrolled precipitation and dissolution of the minerals struvite/vivianite as well as biodegradation or chemical cleavage of metal-chelate complex to recover it in a controlled environment. The instrument will set the stage for increased levels of interdisciplinary collaborations in the fields of nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices, advanced manufacturing, nanotechnology for renewable energy as well as environmental and geotechnical engineering applications across different disciplines and institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
