<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The aim of this project is to explore the connections among green space, perception of risk, and well-being in times of a public health emergency that require people to stay indoors and isolated. In a crisis like the current COVID-19 pandemic, the role of urban green spaces in promoting public health and well-being may be an especially important co-benefit of green infrastructure (GI) programs. However, there is simultaneous acknowledgement that being outdoors, even in green space, is a continuing source of risk for exposure and/or spread of COVID-19. Therefore, this research asks, how do variations in access to green space, whether due to lack of safe, nearby green space and/or the perceived risk associated with being outdoors in particular kinds of spaces during a public pandemic, impact well-being? To answer these questions, this study uses online surveys and video interviews with college students. These students have traveled home from their campuses, returning to a wide variety of residential and landscape forms, presenting an opportunity to conduct comparative study of how access to green space influences responses to current conditions and well-being. The survey, distributed via email, includes questions about well-being, outdoor activity, risk perception, and personal responses to social distancing/self-isolation measures. Interviewees, solicited from survey participants, will be asked questions about available outdoor green space and activity, lifestyle changes in response to COVID-19 and their effect on well-being, the role of outdoor activity in subjects' well-being, and barriers to outdoor activity under present circumstances. Both statistical analyses and qualitative coding analyses will be used to determine (a) subjects' access to different types of green space; (b) subjects' willingness to utilize green space with respect to type, accessibility, and risk perception; and (c) the association of (a) and (b) with subjects' well-being during the pandemic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will expand knowledge on the co-benefits of green infrastructure (GI) programs, with an emphasis on the co-benefit of health and well-being during times of great stress. This study will allow determination of the impacts on well-being for a wide-range of green space types and accessibility, across and within landscape forms (urban, suburban, rural). As such, this study will contribute to understandings of how novel, large-scale stress-inducing events intersect with differences in green space type and access to contribute to inequalities in human well-being. By collecting data from a diverse study population located across a broad area this study will be able to make comparisons across a range of green space types and access. This will further understanding of the mechanisms by which green space affects well-being, applicable to a range of fields like public health, civil engineering, urban ecology, and urban design and planning. This research will address two primary broader implications for well-being in the face of current and future global pandemic-related challenges. First, this study examines how green space access affects well- being during social distancing/stay-at-home conditions, such as those experienced by more than three-fifths of the US population. Second, this study will provide detailed information on subjects' choices and behaviors regarding outdoor recreation during social distancing/stay-at-home conditions, including risk perception and beliefs about the importance of green space access. Together these data will be used to inform current and future preparations and responses to pandemics and other extreme emergency circumstances through recommendations on outdoor recreation, well-being, and current and future planned GI design. Attention to characteristics of neighborhoods by type of building and by population characteristics will support GI planning and implementation by providing fine spatial resolution for the integration of GI contributions to well-being with GI contributions to stormwater management and other environmental benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Life dramatically changed for millions of people in the spring of 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe. In order to protect the health and safety of residents, governments introduced a series of mandates to stay at home, wear masks, maintain six feet of distance ("social distancing"), and close schools, parks, and non-essential businesses.  These response measures were necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19, but they also created a severe social disruption. People reduced their activities outside the home, including time spent outdoors in parks and other greenspaces. The goal of this project was to examine how access to greenspace and connection to nature affected self-reported well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wanted to understand if  different levels of perceived risk had an effect on greenspace access and well-being. We surveyed 1200 university students in the United States during the spring of 2020 at the height of the pandemic. We followed this up with 80 semi-structured interviews.     Intellectual merit:    We found that time spent outside is  correlated with higher levels of self-reported well-being. This correlation is stronger if people went to parks or other greenspaces, like yards and gardens. We also found that concern over COVID-19 risk and transmission negatively affects this relationship. People with higher risk perception spent less time outdoors and their well-being did not improve as much when they went outside. The type of greenspace (public versus private) does not have a significant effect on self-reported well-being. While people living in areas with lower population density have significantly higher well-being when outdoors, the amount a person’s well-being improved from going outside was statistically equal regardless of where they lived. Our findings suggest that greenspace is important for improving and maintaining well-being during times of crisis, but that the accessibility of these spaces changes. We conclude that understanding how greenspace access changes during times of crisis can help those working in public health, greenspace management, and environmental justice better support the population.         Participants who thought going outside was good for their well-being reported higher levels of  well-being both while outdoors and more generally.

Participants were divided as to whether they thought their new connections would endure or not. Further research is needed to empirically investigate long-term transformations in human-nature relations.    Broader Impacts: We trained three undergraduate students and one masters graduate student as research assistants.

One undergraduate student expanded this research into her senior thesis and thus received additional mentoring and professional development on conducting and disseminating research at local and national conferences.
