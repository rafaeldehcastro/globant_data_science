<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the Hormel Institute at the University of Minnesota in collaboration with the State University of New York College at Cortland and Ithaca College, will support 10 students for 12 weeks of virtual research training and professional development during the summer of 2021. In this fully online program, students take part in guided independent research as part of an online community of peers to analyze and predict the relationship between structure and function in biomolecules. To foster community and to strengthen communication skills, students will also participate in weekly informal social events, professional development activities, and meet for an in-person capstone research symposium at the end of the summer. The inherent flexibility of this virtual format make this program broadly accessible to a wide variety of students, including those who would not otherwise be able to access on-site REU programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in this program will learn about molecular interactions and explore structure-function relationships in an environment that is supportive and flexible, guided by a team of faculty and peer mentors. The independent research conducted by the summer research students aims to advance our understanding of enzyme function, primary and secondary metabolism, and may help to provide foundations for improvements in biosynthetic pathway engineering. By pairing relevant and independent research projects with professional development and community building, this program seeks to provide a positive, authentic research experience to a diverse group of students early in their academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

To achieve this goal, our main objective for the REU program was to<em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">provide a positive, productive research experience in an intellectually stimulating, online learning environment that is supportive and flexible.</span></em> We aimed to provide an authentic research experience for participants in order to build confidence in their ability to perform independent research, and to generate meaningful data that could be used to better understand specific molecular interactions that drive the chemistry of life.</p> <p>For the 2021 MIV-REU program year, 14 students (12 NSF-supported) participated from 8 states and the District of Columbia. Half of the students self-reported that they were from groups defined by NSF as under-represented in the sciences (URM). An important objective of the MIV-REU is to provide a research opportunity for students who were unable to participate in a conventional on-site program. For the 2021 cohort of MIV-REU students, greater than 75% reported that they faced barriers to participation in an in person REU program. The most common barriers reported were travel, financial and personal or logistical barriers (see Figure 1). As expected, barriers to participation were more often reported by URM students (~60% of URM students reported barriers) vs. white students (~40% reported barriers).</p> <p>Students conducted independent molecular interactions research guided by a graduate student facilitator, four faculty project mentors and the three faculty PIs. Students and mentors met as a group multiple times per week to plan experiments and report data. In addition, small groups of students met with their sub-groups regularly for additional guidance and support. The work culminated in students proposing and testing a novel hypothesis based on their work. In the final week of the program, the students presented their work in poster format at a virtual symposium held over two days. Throughout the summer, students also participated in weekly professional development activities including interactive sessions on effective literature searches, preparing a CV or resume, online networking tools, and individual development plans, as well as moderated panel discussions on science careers away from the bench, getting into, and making the transition to, graduate school, and challenges faced by women in STEM, among others.</p> <p>Student outcomes, as well as specific program elements, were measured by an independent evaluator using a combination of surveys and focus-group interviews. The evaluator assessed several student metrics and program components. When asked about the likelihood of pursuing a career in science (on a 5-point scale, 5 being the highest likelihood), all of the students responded with a 3 or above, and 93% responded with a 4 or above. Similarly, 93% of the students responded with a 3 or above (87% answered 4 or above) when asked about the likelihood that they would apply to graduate school. An important objective for the MIV-REU program is to increase students' confidence and science identity. When comparing pre- and post-test responses, the 2021 MIV-REU students reported positive gains in science identity and confidence (see Figure 2). When asked if they were "comfortable identifying myself as a scientist" the students' responses increased 25% after completing the program (from an average of 3.25 to 4 on a 5-point scale). Students reported feeling supported by project mentors, graduate-level mentors and by their peers - a quote from a student received during a feedback session read "...they treat me like an actual scientist, which makes me feel like one".</p> <p>One major impact from this program is the demonstration that virtual chemistry research experiences are a viable means to complement in-person research experiences and can be used to expand access to research. The outcomes for this program, which indicated that student participants in the MIV-REU program experienced increases in science identity, felt a strong sense of community, learned valuable soft skills, and were more likely to apply to graduate school, are consistent with the goals and expected outcomes of most in-person REU programs. In addition, this program was able to recruit a diverse group of students who reported barriers that would prevent them from participation in conventional on-site REU programs. As such, the MIV-REU is a demonstration that virtual research experiences can be used to complement existing REU programs to help expand access and support the promotion of inclusion and diversity.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/19/2022<br>      Modified by: Jarrod&nbsp;B&nbsp;French</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051087/2051087_10720222_1649870219141_NSF_REU_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051087/2051087_10720222_1649870219141_NSF_REU_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051087/2051087_10720222_1649870219141_NSF_REU_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A survey of the 2021 MIV-REU participants revealed that more than 75% of the students faced barriers to participation in an �in-person� REU program.</div> <div class="imageCredit">MIV-REU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jarrod&nbsp;B&nbsp;French</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051087/2051087_10720222_1649870281764_Fig_2_NSF_REU--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051087/2051087_10720222_1649870281764_Fig_2_NSF_REU--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051087/2051087_10720222_1649870281764_Fig_2_NSF_REU--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Comparison of pre- and post-program surveys of the 2021 MIV-REU participants illustrated that, among other positive gains, the students saw significant improvements in science identity and confidence.</div> <div class="imageCredit">MIV-REU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jarrod&nbsp;B&nbsp;French</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2.</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
