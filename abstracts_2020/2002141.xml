<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project provides travel and lodging support for graduate and advanced undergraduate students to participate in the 10th biennial North American Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information (NASSLLI) at Brandeis University in July 2020. NASSLLI is a unique educational opportunity for students interested in the interfaces between logic, computer and information science, linguistics, psychology, and philosophy. It brings faculty and students in these disciplines together in courses and workshops, with the goal of furthering our understanding of how minds and machines represent, communicate, manipulate and reason with information expressed in natural language. It also seeks to broaden the research and development communities that are concerned with these issues to achieve gender equity among its practitioners, and become more inclusive of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of NASSLI 2020 is on computational modeling of pragmatics and dialogue, and is the first NASSLLI event that focuses on the implementation of human and machine interactions using natural language. This more practical focus complements NASSLLIâ€™s traditional theoretical concerns in the computer, information and cognitive sciences to include a range of questions in both human and machine intelligence that will be attractive to students. To facilitate the success of students in the week-long intensive courses and participation in the workshops that follow, intensive training in a set of foundational topics is provided during the weekend prior to the start of courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
