<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide technical services to homeowners, local municipalities, engineering and insurance companies to enhance community resilience and sustainability against multi-hazard events such as hurricane that can bring strong wind, storm surge and wide spread inundation. The proposed resilience technology contributes to a paradigm shift in practice from engineering design code methods to performance-based approach that considers structural resiliency concepts and quantifies property hazard risk and value over time. The in-house developed technology utilizes the hydrodynamic simulations to calculate the flood impacts and combines it with the structural and socioeconomic features of built environment. The multi-faceted tool will inform individuals, local municipalities, coastal building designers, increasing the performance and resiliency of this building stock and ensuring greater post-event community function, insurance companies underwriting flood insurances and calculating premiums. Progress and information to be gained through the I-Corps program, in interactions with hazard insurance and risk assessment companies as well as engineering and information service groups will enable our team to expedite the translation of the proposed technology to the market. The developed technologies will be scalable and broadly applicable to other hazard types and regions with potentials of expanding to at international markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to offer a comprehensive predictive tool that provides a pin-point quantitative assessment of the damage and resiliency scenarios of individual properties and up-scaling it to larger infrastructure cluster to introduce a new understanding of the community wide vulnerability considering available social and human capitals. The innovative and ground breaking aspect of this work is that this project for the first time consolidating hydrodynamic, structural and socioeconomic information through a massive big data campaign followed by interactive analysis to open a new window in understanding impacts of extreme events. Specifically, the intellectual merit of this approach resides in its (a) Holistic approach to performance-based design of building (b) Application of state-of-the-art data driven predictive models and advanced computational technologies in flood damage and resiliency assessment of buildings (c) High modularity in building design and prototyping process which supports expansion to other hazards and building types, and (d) Potential to create new knowledge regarding optimal multi-hazard building design. The approach provides comprehensive support to decision makers and designers by estimating building vulnerability and resiliency over construction property, operation and hazards, and by balancing competing objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The goal of this endeavor was to put forward a holistic framework to assess and predict flood vulnerability that will include damage and resilience indexes as major indicators. This project specifically focused on producing a complete approach for flood vulnerability assessment by combining the hydrodynamic and structural characteristics of buildings, solving one of the most important criteria for building level damage assessment. The team gained valuable experience and picked up important skills in business development, communication, leadership and business start-up methodology that focuses on assessing product-market fit through in-person customer discover interviews. The team was able to interviewed more than 100 potential customers across the country by visiting coastal communities in and attending multiple local workshops and town hall meetings. Our I-Corps team was completely immersed in the customer discovery process, understanding the market for their niche research and development and identifying a path for commercialization based on evidence. Through this training the team was able to develop a minimum value product to display significant results to help with the commercialization process. The team gave multiple talks to coastal communities and we are now collaborating with several coastal communities, which also agreed to deploy and test initial versions of the product. The team was able to understand the existing market and develop a path to commercialization as well as making productive contacts with potential insurance companies and coastal communities to solve their existing resiliency issues. The team has published several journal papers, conference proceedings and oral presentations.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/10/2022<br>      Modified by: Rouzbeh&nbsp;Nazari</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
