<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Skidmore College is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an automatic sample changer to support Professor Steven Frey and colleagues Raymond Giguere, Juan Navea, Aurelia Ball and Anna Brezny. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and at nearby State University of New York Adirondack Community College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of an NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the characterization of synthesized manganese(II) complexes used as mimics for superoxide dismutase. The instrumentation is also used for characterizing and modulating the small protein homology 3 (SH3) domain binding pathway biophysics. In addition, it benefits the development of methodology for mechanistic studies in organic electrochemistry and for exploring organic synthesis focusing on intramolecular cycloadditions. The spectrometer is also used for studying the role of pH in the aqueous photochemistry of atmospherically-relevant photosensitizers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>The acquisition of a JEOL JNM-ECZS 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Spectrometer (NMR), funded by the NSF Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, has significantly enhanced chemical and biochemical research and teaching at Skidmore College. This instrument replaced an aging and near-obsolete 300 MHz NMR which could no longer support the research and teaching needs and initiatives of the Chemistry Department. The new instrument provides heightened sensitivity, automated tuning, routine access to multinuclear and variable temperature experiments, and auto-sampling. This NMR has directly benefited research in synthetic modeling of metalloenzymes, structural characterization of protein-protein interactions, mechanistic studies in organic electrochemistry, organic synthesis of tetracyclic compounds, catalytic methods for labeling organic compounds with deuterium, and the investigation of atmospherically-relevant photosensitizers. Specific outcomes of this research include (1) the synthesis and purification of six new ligands that enhance the stability of manganese(II) complexes in aqueous solution and their ability to catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide ion; (2) synthesis of a compound capable of tandem, intramolecular Diels-Alder tetracyclization; (3) comparison of the strengths and locations of the interactions of different peptides with the AbpSH3 protein domain; (4) quantification and mechanistic insight of catalytic incorporation of deuterium in organic substrates; and (5) determination of pKa values of important carboxylic acid photosensitizers found in the atmosphere. The research was disseminated through publications and conference presentations, and included extensive collaboration by 30+ undergraduate student researchers during both the academic year and summer collaborative research periods. These students received advanced training on the NMR, and used it heavily in their work to record <sup>1</sup>H,&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>19</sup>F spectra and run HSQC, HMBC, COSY, NOESY, DEPT, and VT experiments. The instrument was also used extensively in organic and inorganic chemistry lab courses, where more than 150 students received training and utilized the instrument to characterize compounds they made in the laboratory. The NMR is indeed a critical tool for research and teaching at Skidmore, and is housed in the college's new Center for Integrated Sciences where it is a centerpiece of the analytical instrumentation available to faculty and undergraduate students.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/04/2023<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;T&nbsp;Frey</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018494/2018494_10685333_1696449319450_IMG_4780--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018494/2018494_10685333_1696449319450_IMG_4780--rgov-800width.jpg" title="JEOL JNM-ECZ400S NMR Spectrometer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018494/2018494_10685333_1696449319450_IMG_4780--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="JEOL JNM-ECZ400S NMR Spectrometer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Skidmore's JEOL 400 MHz NMR spectrometer, housed in the college's new Center for Integrated Science's.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Steven Frey</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Steven&nbsp;T&nbsp;Frey</div> <div class="imageTitle">JEOL JNM-ECZ400S NMR Spectrometer</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
