<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project aims to serve the national needs of understanding and filling the teacher shortage in secondary mathematics. In particular, it will build capacity to examine systemic issues within and across the teacher workforce pipeline in Hawai‘i. Such issues include influences on the recruitment and education of new mathematics teachers as well as the ongoing professional growth and retention of classroom teachers in high-need schools. This project involves data sharing, collection, analysis, and interpretation among multiple institutions and organizations working collaboratively to address the critical shortage of mathematics teachers in Hawai‘i. It seeks to develop fuller answers to the following questions: What keeps promising individuals from pursuing teaching careers? What barriers or hurdles do aspiring teachers face? What impedes teachers from having long and successful careers in high-need schools and classrooms?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa includes a strategic partnership among all three university campuses (University of Hawai‘i West O‘ahu; University of Hawai‘i Hilo) and two community colleges in the University of Hawai‘i System (Leeward Community College and Kap‘iolani Community College). It also features partnerships with the Hawai‘i State Department of Education, which operates all public schools in the state, as well as with the Hawai‘i Data eXchange Partnership, a collaborative that manages data from Hawai‘i’s education and workforce sectors. Project goals include carrying out cross-institutional research to inform efforts to address Hawai‘i’s mathematics teacher shortage, develop partnerships and engagement for these efforts, and build/refine data collection, sharing, and reuse for these purposes. The project will carry out quantitative and qualitative analyses of multiple data sources, including program documents, secondary sources, and new survey and interview data. The intellectual merit of the project entails advancing knowledge about the mathematics teacher shortage in Hawai‘i. It will offer a research foundation to: design approaches for engaging STEM college students and attracting them into teaching careers; address challenges that aspiring mathematics teachers may face when trying to enter and complete teacher education programs; and better support teachers and administrators at high-need schools. The broader impacts of this project include development of data collection and reuse systems, together with analytic approaches, that will allow stakeholders to look across the teacher workforce pipeline both now and in the future. This Noyce Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The goals of our capacity-building project were to advance our knowledge about the mathematics teacher shortage in Hawai ‘i and offer a research foundation to design approaches for engaging STEM students and attracting them into teaching, to address challenges that aspiring teachers may face, and to better support teachers and administrators at high-needs schools.   Survey and interview data collected from precalculus and calculus students across the state’s public university system of two-year and four-year campuses revealed several themes regarding students’ perceptions about pursuing STEM and teaching careers. The most prevalent factors that contributed to positive opinions about STEM and teaching were their own interests (passion) for mathematics and science, the stability of a teaching career, and the belief that they would make a difference in society and their community. Students also valued peer support and friendships made through college courses, and encouragement from professors, high school teachers, and counselors. Factors that contributed to negative opinions included perceptions of financial demands that would be overwhelming on a teacher’s salary and challenges with the high cost of living in Hawai‘i. Findings from our investigation into the percent of highly-qualified mathematics teachers in Hawai‘i show that there is a persistent need to hire new math teachers every year. On average, data from 2014-2019, show that (1) math teachers have two fewer years of experience than non-math teachers, and (2) an average of 19.1% of all newly hired teachers were non-residents.   Recommendations resulting from the project activities are to  use Get the Facts Out information to correct or clarify information on teacher’s salary relative to other professions, job satisfaction and stability of teaching caree; launch a campaign to gain broad public support and increase financial support for teachers and teachers-in-training to address issues of diversity, equity and inclusion in the profession; and complement existing pathways into teacher education (e.g., with a fellowship program) by attracting teacher hopefuls through community outreach events that celebrate and engage people in STEM activities.
