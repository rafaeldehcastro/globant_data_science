<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop the next generation of wearables. Applications include heated garments, biosensors, textile supercapacitors, and textile energy harvesters. Other conductive yarns that exist to date are either non-textile (metal) or heavily-modified-textile materials (carbon fibers, metal-doped and metal-plated fibers, carbon nanotube-doped yarns, conductive ink-dipped yarns) that often do not look, feel, or behave like conventional textile materials.  This project will deliver launderable, mechanically-rugged, encapsulated conductive yarns that can be seamlessly incorporated into garments and other functional textiles. These yarns are unaffected by strains such as movement, stretching, bending, and physical wear in a garment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops conformal, uniform, and robust textiles based on conductive yarns using a process of oxidative chemical vapor deposition. The project uses the conductive flexible polymers to form coatings in the vapor phase under low vacuum. The vapor allows for high conformality to the yarn's rough surface and uniform layer thickness across the circumference, both due to the mean free path of the monomers and oligomers after reaching the yarn surface during deposition. The low vacuum environment can be used to tune these parameters to improve polymerization in the lateral direction, rather than outward from the surface, as occurs in other processes. In turn, the coatings' conformality and uniformity leaves the yarn largely unaffected only marginally impacts its weight. Furthermore, with the vapor phase reaction, the process offers excellent chemical and physical adhesion unparalleled even with solution methods, as observed by conductivity unaffected by many wash cycles and significant wear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Soliyarn's CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) technology is able to coat fabrics and yarns in an eco-friendly manner with durable, thin films to achieve different surface properties. This technology has many applications which can be achieved by simply changing the chemical constituents being deposited during the reaction, similar to how a 3d printer can create objects with different material properties by simply changing the filament type. Two main applications of this technology were explored during this Phase I Award: (1) Creating electrically conductive fabric and (2) creating omniphobic (meaning it repels both water and oil) fabric. Even though these are two independent applications, they are applied with the same CVD technology. In short, our product is our process. With the knowledge gained during the implementation of these two applications, Soliyarn is expecting to scale the production process to a roll-to-roll system in the future.      With the growing popularity of wearables in the last few years, academics and industrial researchers alike have been exploring ways to incorporate the advantages of these devices in new ways.  To further the development of wearable technology, next generation devices will need to make it possible for wearables to collect data from practically every part of the body accurately, comfortably and for longer periods of time. Further, their production will need to be achieved in an eco-friendly and scalable manner. A significant first step in achieving this is making electrically conductive fabric. Soliyarn's fabric coatings will enable the implementation of sensors on any part of the body where fabric is present, will eliminate the bulk from wires and lower electronic waste. During this Phase 1 award it was demonstrated that chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can be scaled up from the lab scale production (4 square inches) to produce a batch scale (20 square inches) of conducting polymer coated fabric reliably. The company successfully confirmed that larger batch production was possible by optimizing the larger scale chamber and creating a process that is predictable and repeatable. Following the production of the conductive fabric, as a proof of concept for its capabilities we developed a first of its kind prototype heated glove which was able to be heated up to 160 degrees Fahrenheit. This glove uses no wires internally, is much more dexterous than anything currently on the market and allows for much easier implementation in the manufacturing process than current wired solutions.      The Phase 1 also resulted in the identification of a new market opportunity.  While conducting customer discovery interviews for the Beat-The-Odds program, Soliyarn learned of regulation in place in Europe to eliminate all fabric waterproofing that use per-fluorinated-compounds (PFCs) by 2024 and that the US is likely to follow. There is a push in the outdoor apparel industry to move away from waterproof coatings that use (PFCs) because these are widely known to harm aquatic life. This discovery drove Soliyarn to develop a low-cost high throughput PFC-free/fluorine free waterproof and oleophobic CVD coating process, that does not change the look, feel, or usage of the original fabric. Multiple successful uniform coatings were deposited using a proprietary PFC-free formulation. Contact angle measurements (which measures hydrophobicity of a material, with greater than 90 degrees indicating hydrophobicity) were taken on four fabrics before and after the PFC-free waterproof coating was applied. On average, contact angles increased from 59 degrees to 146 degrees uniformly across all the fabrics.      Adding value to this new discovery, the company participated in the I-Corps program and completed over 135 customer discovery interviews. These interviews added depth in understanding of the market and aided in developing new industry relationships in both conductive and PFC free coatings. Overall, the Phase I effort was a great success for Soliyarn.  It allowed the team to mature its CVD process and learn of a path for creating low-cost roll-to-roll manufacturing solutions that can continuously coat bolts of yarn with conducting polymer and could potentially revitalize the US textile industry with the use of advanced materials in an environmentally friendly manner.
