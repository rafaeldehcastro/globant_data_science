<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[There is a large semantic gap between the high-level understanding of an application's goals and the sequence of processor instructions and memory accesses observed by computer hardware. This is due to the long-standing narrow interface between software and the computing platform it is running on, which acts as a semantic wall that prevents the platform from meeting application needs. The cost of this wall is growing with the rapid increase in specialized hardware accelerators and new classes of memory and storage. This project razes the semantic wall by developing a fundamentally more expressive interface, called prescriptive memory, which enables more semantic information to be conveyed from applications to system software to hardware.  Prescriptive memory will enable applications to take advantage of new hardware accelerators and new memory technologies, spurring market acceptance, which in turn spurs industry investment both in more advanced accelerators and memories and in application software that uses them.  This virtuous cycle boosts the entire high tech ecosystem, which in turn boosts all aspects of society that benefit from improved computer performance.  Prescriptive memory will also improve the energy-efficiency of computations in data centers, reducing their carbon footprint.  As a general and powerful abstraction, prescriptive memory will provide significant--often game changing--benefits to a wide range of applications.  The project will demonstrate such benefits for important applications in robotics and machine learning, with a showcase application being training robots to perform complicated tasks with and among humans in cluttered environments, safely and effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will define a prescriptive memory abstraction that enables higher-level properties to be associated with dynamic regions of a program's memory. It is through these properties that semantic intent, application goals, application preferences, etc. are expressed and conveyed throughout the software stack down to the hardware.  The project will design and implement an open source software stack that supports and benefits from the new abstraction.  A unifying hardware mechanism will be developed that enables hardware to leverage these properties to reduce overheads and better meet application needs.  A super-controller will be designed and implemented that, based on these properties and dynamic system state information, makes (near-)optimal decisions on data placement and accelerator use at every point in time.  The project will explore how prescriptive memory benefits a range of applications bottlenecked by the semantic wall, with a specific focus on providing orders of magnitude improvements in the speed and scale (fidelity) of robotic worlds simulations, a key to enabling safe and effective "AI in the wild."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

This is due to the long-standing narrow interface between software and the computing platform it is running on. This interface acts as a semantic wall that hinders application performance optimizations, and is only becoming more costly given the rapid increase in heterogeneity in computing platforms.  The overarching goal of the project is to raze this semantic wall by developing a fundamentally more expressive interface, called Prescriptive Memory, and then using this new knowledge to design a novel open source software stack that can realize the full potential of platform heterogeneity.  This planning grant was used to take concrete first steps towards this overaching vision, with an emphasis on exploring how Prescriptive Memory can provide orders of magnitude improvements in "AI in the wild" applications. Concrete outcomes included:   We identified path planning as a core      AI-in-the-wild task that can be significantly sped up (by 34-41x) using      semantic information and hardware accelerators. We demonstrated how semantic information alone      (i.e., without hardware accelerators) can speed up (by 3-14x)      a variety of path planning tasks, including drone-navigation, robotic arm      maneuvering, and protein design. We showed how semantic information can speed up machine learning inference for state-of-the-art machine learning models by up to 14x. We designed a low overhead hardware-software approach for enforcing (semantic) control-flow integrity properties of application programs. We designed, implemented, and released open source      a benchmarking suite for robotics (https://cmu-roboarch.github.io/rtrbench/). We designed, implemented, and released open source      a FPGA-based framework for conveying semantic information to hardware      components.     The project resulted in 9 paper publications, an open-source benchmark suite, and an open-source framework for conveying semantic information to hardware components. The project helped train three PhD students. Graduate students completed course projects on the topic of this project.
