<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[For many U.S. citizens the rapidly increasing threat of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to widespread behavior change, including social distancing and self-quarantine. Determining the social and psychological factors that predict unwillingness to engage in preventative health behaviors is crucial to develop strategies for reducing widespread disease.  This project identifies psychosocial factors associated with preventative behavior change, thereby highlighting who may be at greater risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19 and future infectious diseases.  The research will inform interventions designed to increase preventative health behaviors that reduce pathogen transmission.  The threat of COVID-19 has also altered many social attitudes, including bias toward specific groups such as people of Asian descent.  This project will shed light on the long-term consequences of such social changes for policy, international relations, and individual decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project informs and advances basic understanding of the human Behavioral Immune System (BIS).  The BIS is theorized to encompass a variety of behaviors that humans adopt to reduce disease infection, making this research particularly timely. The research tests predictions regarding how fear of contagion influences health related behaviors and social attitudes. One goal is to quantify the extent to which social behaviors and attitudes have changed in response to the COVID-19 threat.  The moderating effects of individual differences (personality traits, demographics, disgust sensitivity) will also be tested. The research utilizes a novel, intensive longitudinal design that follows a large nationally representative U.S. sample for one year.  Data will be collected throughout the pandemic, decreasing in frequency as the threat subsides.  Online surveys will assess preventative behaviors (e.g., handwashing, social distancing), social attitudes (prejudice, dangerous worldview, social beliefs), and individual difference variables. National statistics regarding COVID-19 prevalence in each survey respondentâ€™s locale will also be collected to determine whether changes in social attitudes and behavior parallel changes in COVID-19 threat. The project will inform current and future efforts for increasing preventative health behaviors and reducing the spread of disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary objective of Award 2027027 was to determine the extent to which social attitudes and behavior changed in response to pathogen threat posed by COVID-19 in the US. A secondary objective was to test moderating effects of trait-level indices of the behavioral immune system (i.e., disgust sensitivity and germ aversion). A year-long longitudinal study was conducted. A nationally representative sample of approximately 1000 U.S. adults was recruited. Participants were surveyed online from March 2020 to March 2021 on a weekly to monthly basis, resulting in 29 waves of data. To date, this project has resulted in three articles in peer-reviewed journals and four conference presentations. We have found that disgust sensitivity and germ aversion were significantly associated with greater concern about COVID-19, greater engagement in preventive health behaviors (e.g., hand-washing, social distancing), and less COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We have also found that financial and employment concerns were significant contributors to worse mental health (greater depression and anxiety) during the COVID-19 pandemic, more so than other pandemic-related stressors. Further, older age was a buffer against some of the negative impact of the pandemic on mental health. That is, older adults reported better mental health than younger adults, and COVID-19 concerns were less strongly associated with mental health in older adults as compared to younger adults. These results have implications for multiple fields of study (e.g., psychology, public health, gerontology, human resources). The findings expand our basic understanding of behavioral immune system theory and the roles of disgust sensitivity and germ aversion in shaping attitudes and behavior. More broadly, the results from this project may inform interventions designed to increase preventive health behaviors, reduce pandemic-related stressors, and decrease vaccine hesitancy. Data from this project has increased our understanding of reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, which will better prepare us for responding to future pandemics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the course of this award, five graduate students and 11 undergraduate students received training.
