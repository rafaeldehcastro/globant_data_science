<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[While alcohol and tobacco used independently may have different effects on labor market outcomes of users, it is not clear how the combined use of both affects labor market outcomes of users.  This research project uses economic theory and data from National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 97 (NLSY-97) to investigate the relationships among alcohol and tobacco use on the one hand and employment on the other.  The researcher argues that while moderate alcohol use may have a positive labor market effect through increase social interaction, heavy alcohol use may have large negative effects.  Moreover, the interaction of alcohol and tobacco use may have effects that may be either positive or negative depending on the individual.  The researcher tests this theory using data from the NLSY-79.  Apart from providing a better understanding of the effects of substance use on employment and other labor market outcomes, it also provides a measurement of the unintended consequences of substance use policies.  The results of the research project will provide inputs into crafting and implementing better substance use policies, thus improving the wellbeing of US citizens.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research project will use structural modelling and data from NLSY-97 to investigate the effects of substance use on labor market outcomes.  The project develops and applies a methodology to separately explain the extent to which moderate versus heavy alcohol and tobacco use affect employment, accounting for part-time and full-time employment.  The model suggests that moderate use of alcohol may have beneficial labor market effects.  Accounting for heterogeneity and non-linearities in the effects of substance use on labor market outcomes is an innovation to the literature that has so far assumed a linear relationship.  The model will be estimated with data from NLSY-97.  Given that alcohol and tobacco regulation policies focus on decrease use, it is possible that these policies may be suboptimal. The research will also conduct policy counterfactuals use polices that may create social capital through moderate substance use.  The proposed research agenda also include a large dose of undergraduate and graduate education, including developing a workshop series in the Economics of Risky Behaviors.  The results of the research project will provide inputs into crafting and implementing better substance use policies, thus improving the wellbeing of US citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Heavy drinking is common in the United States, as one in six U.S. adults binge drink and 25% binge drink at least weekly. Given the high prevalence of alcohol consumption particularly among individuals of working age and the importance of employment for economic prosperity, it is crucial to understand the relationship between alcohol use and individual success in the labor market. Casual observation suggests that moderate alcohol use is associated with higher likelihood of employment, relative to heavy alcohol consumption or alcohol abstention. These patterns could be causal (e.g. if heavy alcohol consumption is detrimental to health while moderate consumption increases social capital) or they simply be correlational relationships (e.g. if individuals with more self-control are more likely to consume alcohol in moderation and also more likely to be employed at any given point in time regardless of their alcohol consumption).   How can research separately identify the effects of moderate drinking from the effects of heavy drinking?  If it were possible to run a controlled experiment, one would want to randomly assign alcohol abstention, moderate alcohol consumption, and heavy alcohol consumption to three different groups of individuals, comparing subsequent employment outcomes among the three groups.  As such an experiment is impractical and infeasible for a variety of reasons, it is necessary to look for another approach to answering this question. Ordinarily, a researcher might seek to identify a natural experiment that exogenously shifts alcohol consumption separately at the intensive as well as the extensive margin of consumption.  However, while policymakers have control over a wide array of tools that influence alcohol use , for example, alcohol excise taxes, minimum legal drinking age and mandated closing times for bars among others, variation in drinking brought about by these policies does not allow us to discern between the effects of moderate versus heavy drinking.  In other words, while policymakers have used tools at their disposal to elicit changes in the volume of alcohol consumed, none of these tools explicitly cause modest drinkers to consume alcohol more heavily without inducing other changes in alcohol use among heavy users.  This limitation means that natural experiments cannot be used to causally disentangle the effect of moderate versus heavy alcohol consumption on employment. In the absence of a randomized controlled trial or a natural experiment, how can researchers separately identify the effects of moderate versus heavy drinking?  An alternative approach is to use structural methods, allowing an econometrician to write down a behavioral model that separates tastes from habit formation. Similar models have been used in marketing to explain persistence in brand loyalty, separately identifying the causal effect from past consumption on current consumption from heterogeneous unobserved preferences that induce different people to show brand loyalty.   This project develops a structural model that separately identifies habit formation from unobserved preferences and will be the first study to separately estimate the effect of moderate versus heavy alcohol consumption on the probability of maintaining full-time employment.  I use longitudinal data and focus on low-skilled young adults (between the ages of 18 and 22), and model their employment and alcohol consumption trajectories between 2002 and 2011. The NLSY97 follows respondents starting in 1997, and 2002 would be the first year where schooling decisions are not interfering with employment trajectories, as respondents are at least 18. I focus on adults with less than a college degree at the final wave of the survey in order to not have their employment trajectory affected by schooling decisions.   My primary finding is that moderate alcohol consumption increases employment. On the other hand, heavy alcohol consumption has a negative effect on employment, which dissipates when the model takes into account cigarette consumption. This pattern is consistent with smoking, and not heavy alcohol per se, being detrimental to employment.    This project potentially helps us to better understand the ways in which regulations governing the use and sale of alcohol affect labor market attachments in the United States.  If there exists undocumented gains of moderate alcohol consumption, currently existing policies that affect all levels may end up lowering employment in ways that have not previously been expected.   Even though respondents over (under) 21 years of age are (are not) legally allowed to purchase or consume alcohol, there is no policy differentiation at the intensive margin.  One of the fundamental problems of economics is the ability to recommend policies. Among the main attractions of structural models is that they enable researchers to simulate policy counterfactuals, while holding preferences and other parameters constant. In particular, I evaluate the extent to which a one-time shock in moderate versus heavy alcohol consumption affects future employment. In the absence of actual policies that target alcohol separately at the intensive and extensive margin, these policy counterfactuals sheds light on potential negative externalities of currently existing alcohol regulation policies.
