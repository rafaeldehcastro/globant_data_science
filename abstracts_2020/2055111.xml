<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Scientists study the complex interconnections between the social, political, and economics systems that shaped past lifeways. Archaeology is well suited to this study because the material remains of the past are embedded with the sociopolitical and economic relationships at play when the materials were constructed. By investigating the production and distribution of ceramics used by cultures in the past, researchers can reconstruct the complex and interconnected relationships that existed in the region inhabited by this cultural group. The time-period under consideration saw dramatic shifts in social and political organization and tracing the patterns of organizational change in the material record is relevant to current understandings of modern sociopolitical and economic relationships that shape and are shaped by our interactions with material goods. The investigators plan to collaborate closely with local artisans and non-profit organizations to develop programs designed to encourage the safeguarding of cultural heritage as well as the education of members of local communities about cultural heritage and archaeology. This project was designed with inclusivity in mind, introducing creative project design and perspectives into the archaeological process, while ensuring that results are accessible to multiple voices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doctoral dissertation project will model a ceramic economy by examining the production and distribution of fine-ware ceramic vessels from two sites to highlight the dynamic shifts in social complexity that occurred during this period. Within a framework of ritual economy, the study will analyze and compare the mineral and chemical compositions of ceramic assemblages from the sites to test the hypothesis that a larger site served as a node of public activity a place for political, social, and ritual congregation for local residents as well as those from other surrounding communities. To test this model, the doctoral student will conduct stylistic analysis, petrography, and Neutron Activation Analysis on the fine-ware ceramics from two assemblages. Micro-level characteristics of the vessels will reveal macro-level relationships between populations and their practices because these dynamics are embedded in the material record at the time of its production and distribution. Investigations of this nature highlight the inextricable link between the economic, political, and social structures that shape society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project developed a multimethod approach to study Middle Preclassic (1000 - 300 BCE) Maya ceramics from two sites in western Belize. Early Xunantunich and San Lorenzo sit at what would historically be considered opposite ends of the sociopolitical scale. Early Xunantunich, a ritual center established on a large hill and overlooking the river valley below, boasted monumental construction as early as 800 BCE. The site likely served as a location of feasting and ritual performances that drew different communities together in one place. Visible from this early monumental site was the community of San Lorenzo. Settled on the bank of the Mopan River, the Maya living at San Lorenzo took advantage of the rich alluvial soils of the floodplain for subsistence agriculture. This project conducted ceramic analysis to model and test the relationship between these two sites in a period of social, political, and economic fluctuations as social hierarchies and new political systems grew.</p> <p>The model developed for this project investigates the visual, mineralogical, and chemical characteristics of ceramics from each site to highlight the power of collective gatherings in the past without assuming top-down control from the larger, public center (Early Xunantunich). On the contrary, the model recognizes the contribution of material to the center rather than the control of material from the center outward. The model also tests the organization of production in the region, especially important as ancient Maya potters did not develop archaeologically visible technology like kilns or throwing wheels. The project considered regional collaboration from the start, with its model and material correlates applicable to sites across and outside the Upper Belize River valley region. Project results and future collaborations have the potential to reconstruct more of the Middle Preclassic Maya economic structure and sociopolitical relationships.</p> <p>The project has revealed that Middle Preclassic potters from San Lorenzo and Early Xunantunich were likely engaging in site-specific production. Mineralogical "recipes" and chemical markers show clearly delineated signatures between both sites. Finding distinct signatures at sites as geographically and geologically close as San Lorenzo and Early Xunantunich has not been seen elsewhere in the region. A subset of samples produced by San Lorenzo potters excavated from Early Xunantunich may represent ceramic material brought from the community to the ritual center during participation in collective gathering activities.</p> <p>These data are critical to a broader understanding of life in the Mopan River valley nearly 3000 years ago. Because the project sites are geographically centered between the Middle Preclassic centers of Cahal Pech to the east and Holtun to the west, the model is uniquely positioned to address the recent call for an "interregional synthesis" of investigations of Preclassic pottery (Callaghan et al. 2018: 822). The data repository at The University of Missouri Archaeometry Laboratory has confirmed that a few vessels at Early Xunantunich were produced non-locally, highlighting the relationships that the monumental site had with surrounding communities during this early period. The collaborative ethos built into this project further underlines its applicability to other regions, crafting traditions, and cultural areas.</p> <p>The final node of this project's design was ethnoarchaeological collaboration with traditional Maya potters from San Jose Succotz, located across the Mopan River from Early Xunantunich. Work with these potters - who strived for decades to revitalize the village's cultural history through crafting and the arts - involved collecting material from five local clay sources and creating ceramic tiles using traditional techniques passed down by their Maya grandparents. These tiles served as controls for the mineralogical and chemical characteristics of clay sources surrounding the project sites.</p> <p>More than this, collaboration with the Succotz potters incorporated the voices of heritage communities into the design and implementation of the project. Research perspectives shifted from purely material to the ancient creators of the assemblages and the way decisions at every stage of production were influenced by the surrounding social, political, and economic environment. The impact of this collaboration is the link between the past and present, highlighting the traditions that form that link. By collaborating with the Succotz potters and incorporating what they wished to learn from the past, it was clear the project should serve the community beyond the dissemination of information. The data gathered and conclusions drawn by the project will be available to local potters. If they are interested in different firing techniques, inspiration for new motifs, or how ancient materials behaved when processed, that information is available through this project. The ultimate hope of the Succotz potters was for their community to become self-sufficient by resurrecting traditions like farming and pottery production. To share that hope and to show the community that quality resources are locally available is an impact that will become more critical in the coming years, as effects of the pandemic and rising economic/political tensions are felt both in Belize and across the world.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/29/2023<br>      Modified by: Alessandra&nbsp;N&nbsp;Villarreal</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2055111/2055111_10711485_1696017234138_PartialVessel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2055111/2055111_10711485_1696017234138_PartialVessel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Partial Vessel, Early Xunantunich"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2055111/2055111_10711485_1696017234138_PartialVessel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Partial Vessel, Early Xunantunich"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Interior and exterior views of a partial Savana Orange bowl excavated from Structure E-2, Early Xunantunich.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alessandra Villarreal</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alessandra&nbsp;N&nbsp;Villarreal</div> <div class="imageTitle">Partial Vessel, Early Xunantunich</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2055111/2055111_10711485_1696017403875_MopanMap--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2055111/2055111_10711485_1696017403875_MopanMap--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Maya Sites of the Upper Belize River Valley, Belize"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2055111/2055111_10711485_1696017403875_MopanMap--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Maya Sites of the Upper Belize River Valley, Belize"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Elevation map of the ancient Maya sites in the project region, including (Early) Xunantunich and San Lorenzo.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mopan Valley Archaeology Project</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alessandra&nbsp;N&nbsp;Villarreal</div> <div class="imageTitle">Maya Sites of the Upper Belize River Valley, Belize</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2055111/2055111_10711485_1696017581310_Davidburnishing--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2055111/2055111_10711485_1696017581310_Davidburnishing--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Burnishing Modern Clay Tiles"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2055111/2055111_10711485_1696017581310_Davidburnishing--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Burnishing Modern Clay Tiles"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Modern Maya potter, David, burnishing a tile with a small pebble.
