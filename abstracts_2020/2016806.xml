<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project conducts a case study of attempts to reform regulation of a United States profession in the late 1990s and early 2000s, culminating in reforms enacted in 2002.  Professionals can use their expert knowledge in ways that cause harm to clients, third parties, and society in general.  A variety of regulatory approaches are possible for limiting or preventing such harm, including self-regulation, state regulation, or “regulation” by private market mechanisms.  Professions have traditionally regulated themselves, but in recent years many countries have seen a gradual shift away from this model toward an increasing regulatory role for states.  We know relatively little about why change is occurring in this particular direction.  This study is a step toward increasing our understanding that additionally permits the development of theory explaining how and why similar shifts toward increased state regulation of professions have occurred in a number of settings and might occur in the future.  More generally, the study sheds light on the circumstances that facilitate or impede change in the regulation of professional services, and begins to identify the limits on the possibilities open to societies to curb the misuse of expert knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design is a case study in which the interactions among key actors and stakeholder groups involved in seeking, resisting, and shaping state-based regulation during the late 1990s and the early 2000s are traced.  The case presents a kind of natural experiment: revelation of serious misconduct in the profession in 2001-2002 allows comparison of the same actors, decision options, and arguments before and after this key event.  The data are primarily documentary: speeches, transcripts of hearings, government reports, and articles from both the professional trade press and the general news media.  In addition to developing new theory and informing future efforts at regulatory change, the project will build intellectual bridges between the study of professions and other subfields and disciplines.  It will also contribute to revitalizing research on professional and expert work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent years many countries have seen a shift away from self-regulation by professions toward increasing state involvement in professional regulation.  Existing explanations of professional regulatory arrangements explain them as resulting from a ?regulatory bargain? between the profession and the state, in which in which the state grants a professional community freedom from external regulation in return for the profession?s commitment to protect clients and the public from harm.  However, such theories do not help us to understand recent developments in which the state takes over regulatory authority despite the profession?s opposition.  This project sought to develop theory explaining this phenomenon by conducting a case study of two episodes involving efforts to reform the regulation of the accounting profession in the United States from 1996 to 2000 and from late 2001 to 2002.  The first episode was only modestly successful, resulting in fairly mild agency regulations, while the second episode led to the enactment of significant legislation.      Through an analysis of Congressional and regulatory agency documents, speeches, newspaper and magazine articles, and interview transcripts, the study found that the same two processes operated during both episodes.  First, existing self-regulatory arrangements gradually became de-legitimated and de-institutionalized, due in part to the accounting profession?s own inattention to self-regulation while they pursued a new, more exciting and more lucrative vision of the profession.  Second, a different regulatory model ? involving a quasi-governmental body composed primarily of independent, public members ? gradually became legitimated and institutionalized.  During the first episode, these processes did not yet come to fruition.  A steady drip of accounting scandals, together with professional overreach in other areas, weakened the legitimacy of professional self-regulation but did not fully undermine it.  Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt acted as an institutional entrepreneur by proposing and promoting discussion of an independent quasi-governmental regulatory body.  The idea gained currency but did not become fully legitimated before the Clinton administration ended and Levitt left office.  These de-institutionalization and re-institutionalization processes were fully accomplished during the second episode, the bankruptcies of the Enron and WorldCom corporations helped to complete the de-legitimation of the existing self-regulatory system.  This process was also aided by the increasing distrust of rank-and-file, non-elite accountants, who perceived the elite professional association and elite firms as pursuing interests that they did not share, and who resoundingly rejected the elite?s vision of a broader, globalized profession in a formal vote.  At the same time, the idea of an independent quasi-governmental body was resurrected and became accepted as the best way forward.         The first episode provided an essential prelude to the second.  The scandals of 2001 and 2002 were understood against the backdrop of the partial de-legitimation that occurred during the first episode, whereas without it they might have been seen merely as unfortunate but unusual incidents.  That partial destabilization also accentuated the cleavage between the elite and non-elite segments of the accounting profession, weakening non-elite support for the elite in their battle with the state in the second episode.  Moreover, the partial institutionalization of the idea of a quasi-governmental body during the first episode that these ideas achieved during the first episode made it much easier for policymakers to retrieve and adopt them during the second episode.  The findings here suggest, then, that successful shifts from professional self-regulation to quasi-governmental regulation are more likely to occur when a gradual de-institutionalization of self-regulatory arrangements has been going on for some time and an institutional entrepreneur makes some headway toward establishing acceptance of a new regulatory form.
