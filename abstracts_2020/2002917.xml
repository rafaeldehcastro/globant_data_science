<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a highly efficient, cost-effective system for direct conversion of CO2 to useful chemicals, while minimizing waste and emissions. The potential impacts include, but are not limited to, new cost-effective utilization of the abundant CO2 both within the atmosphere and from point source emissions, such as power plants, for the production of value-added chemicals. The heart of this technology is a 'microreactor' that allows process intensification and thus increased productivity compared to a conventional reactor.  Microreactors offer enhanced productivity, safety, and robustness.  The proposed unit can be developed as an easily deployable, standalone unit or to retrofit existing plants. Moreover, this project will deliver major benefits to the chemical process industries by accelerating response to market changes, simplifying scale-up, enabling rapid development and deployment of new products, simplifying on-site gas treatment and processing, and reducing the environmental impact and safety risks inherent to pipeline transportation to a central facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on designing and building a standalone highly intensified unit to leverage the high productivity of microreactors in developing small scale Gas-To-Liquid (GTL) plants converting CO2 into value-added chemicals. A microreactor containing microchannels is ideal for process intensification in chemical engineering as it (1) enhances the heat and mass transfer processes; (2) allows precise adjustment of the initial and boundary conditions, as well as the residence or contact time for continuous chemical reactions; and (3) represents inherently safe plant operation.  The decrease in the physical dimensions (miniaturization) of a unit leads to enhanced mixing and heat exchange, thereby improving the surface area per unit volume and subsequent mass and heat transfer rates. The proposed system will be a highly intensified standalone plant consisting of catalytic microreactor units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The primary objective of this project was to evaluate the commercial feasibility of modular units manufactured using microreactors that can convert waste carbon dioxide emissions from various source points like chemical and process industries into useful chemicals.  The NSF- I-Corps cohort participation helped us to interact with various customers in the field of oil and gas, automobile, cement, pharmaceutical small/medium/large scale chemical and process industries.  The key outcomes after aggressive customer discovery process during the 6 weeks of our cohort session are shown below:  The interactions with all the customers in the initial business model like chemical and process industries, cement, oil and gas and pharmaceutical companies has sticked out since the handling of CO2 emissions is not a major concern as today By end of the 4th week of the cohort sessions, we were able to narrow down the customer segment to small/medium scale chemical process industries such as ethanol plants. From the customer interactions, we learned that ethanol plants can emit almost pure carbon dioxide from their outlet steam. One of the major strengths of our research hypothesis is that microreactor modular units can be economical by eliminating the CO2 purification step. Further participation in the National ethanol conferences helped us to interact with 80 delegates from ethanol industry like chemical engineers/ process engineers/ plant managers and CEOs. The data acquired from this interesting customer segments helped us to understand that all the ethanol plants target the California ethanol standards to get access to the California market.

However, ethanol plants reach the California market standards by optimizing the carbon life cycle analysis without chemical utilization of the carbon dioxide. This contradicts the hypothesis of our business model and eliminated our most important customer segment that we considered to start with. By end of the cohort session, to validate all the projected customer segments, we conducted some initial customer interviews in the automobile industry. To our surprise, the handling of CO2 emissions is really a major challenge in this industry. We have considered to move forward with this customer segment after the completion of 6 weeks NSF I corps cohort session at Dallas, Texas. The interactions with design engineers, sustainable engineers and process managers from various automobile industries helped us to understand that a very miniature device can solve a major carbon emissions control challenge in heavy duty vehicles like trucks.   Based on the customer discovery process in the NSF-I-Corps program, we have made major changes in our current research projects dealing with CO2.  We are investigating syngas conversion enriched with CO2 by varying carbon dioxide concentration, evaluating  stable catalysts for CO2 conversion and optimization of microreactor design to have a robust reactor for our process. The data generated from these studies have been used in our manuscripts submitted to different journals and two patent applications under preparation (Invention disclosure filed).
