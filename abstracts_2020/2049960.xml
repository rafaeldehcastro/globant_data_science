<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The continuous prevalence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and the blurring boundary between cyber and physical systems have brought a plethora of opportunities to improve our ways of life. Along with the opportunities come the security risks associated with the rapid introduction and integration of information technologies and operational technologies. This project aims to foster collaborations between U.S. researchers and those from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland to leverage expertise toward development of novel research projects in the thematic areas of IoT/Cyberphysical (CPS) Cybersecurity. This trilateral collaboration will facilitate identification of key science questions and develop mutually beneficial partnerships to address them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two virtual interactive webinars and an in-person culminating workshop will bring together researchers and industry representative in Forensic-ready IoT/CPS, Privacy Preserving CPS, and Adversarial Learning CPS, as well as Crosscutting Research in Policy and Usability. The outcome is expected to be innovative and viable solutions proposed by multiple trilateral collaborative teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
