<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to facilitate safety for medical radiation workers.  Many of these workers must wear radiation shielding as personal protective equipment for much of their workday. Currently used shielding garments are often unsterilizable, heavy and rigid, and difficult to inspect for cracks or tears; these issues add risk and cost to health care. The proposed radiation shielding materials will enable personnel to easily sterilize garments between uses, decreasing the risk of transmitting infections in operating rooms. Garments made from this material are expected to be more ergonomic to wear for long periods of time as well as easier to inspect and maintain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish feasibility of a sterilizable and non-toxic radiation shielding fabric and will demonstrate radiation shielding efficacy and workability. Microparticle materials developed from a novel manufactured composite. This project will evaluate and screen potential polymers and processing conditions. The testing and evaluation plan will characterize materials in terms of strength, resistance to breakage, and chemical resistance. The project will assess radiation shielding efficacy using X-ray energies and conditions expected in a clinical setting. The fabric will also be evaluated for plasticity and its capability to be implemented in a garment that can be cleaned and sterilized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
