<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused major human health and economic impacts. One of the most critical questions is determining who is infected to help understand how rapidly the outbreak has progressed. With the continuing mismatch between testing need and capacity, alternative methods are needed to assess the outbreak. Further difficulty in monitoring the outbreak results from the fact that most infected individuals do not show COVID-19 symptoms immediately. These issues limit the ability of decision makers to determine where outbreaks are occurring within their communities, when outbreaks start, and when outbreaks slow or stop. The goal of this project is to address such limitations by developing the science behind monitoring the spread of the disease through community wastewater surveillance. To achieve this goal, the research will measure SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the wastewater system. This new detection method will allow for decision makers to assess potential outbreaks before symptomatic people request testing. In addition, results will help determine which communities have infected individuals. This is particularly important to assess whether the COVID-19 outbreak is slowing in response to interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to determine the onset, duration, termination, and location of the COVID-19 outbreak via wastewater surveillance. This work will test two hypotheses that: 1) SARS-CoV2 virus RNA concentrations in sewage and stormwater correlates with the initiation, progression, and decline of a communityâ€™s aggregate COVID-19 infection; 2) Spatial sampling within a sewer system network can isolate the location of COVID-19 hotspots within a given community. To test these hypotheses, two objectives will be completed: 1) SARS-CoV2 RNA in four Clean Water Services (CWS, Washington County, Oregon) wastewater treatment facilities and stormwater collection systems will be quantified using reverse transcriptase droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) on a weekly basis. In the wastewater treatment plants, SARS-CoV2 RNA will be quantified in liquid primary clarifier effluent and in primary clarifier solids. At stormwater collection systems, SARS-CoV2 RNA will be quantified from the liquid and solid fractions. 2) SARS-CoV2 RNA will be quantified using RT-ddPCR at 12 selected sampling points throughout the CWS sewer system network on a biweekly basis through June, 2020, and monthly for the remainder of the project. The results will be incorporated into a GIS system containing publicly available demographic databases to identify COVID-19 hotspots and possible underlying contributing factors. The results of this work will demonstrate the feasibility of using wastewater collected at a centralized treatment facility to monitor COVID-19 outbreaks for an entire community. A second outcome of this work will determine how SARS-CoV2 RNA partitions between wastewater solids and liquid factions. Additionally, this work will determine if stormwater is a potential reservoir of SARS-CoV2 RNA during a COVID-19 outbreak.  Finally, this work will demonstrate how sampling throughout a sewer line network can identify COVID-19 outbreak hotspots. If successful, this research could lead to other similar monitoring efforts for other viral outbreaks and protect the public health of the Nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Working with collaborators throughout the country, we observed that the method used to collect and quantify the SARS-CoV-2 virus from wastewater can alter the final reported concentration by orders of magnitude.  This has made it difficult to compare SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations from one study to another.  However, we also found that when researchers used the same methods of viral collection and quantification, similar results can be obtained, making it possible to have a high level of confidence of data coming from any single study that uses a consistent methodology.  Additionally, this study found that it is important to use composite samples (i.e., a series of samples taken over time and then added together) rather than using grab samples (i.e., a single sample taken at a single time point) when collecting wastewater for surveillance purposes.  This becomes even more critical as the sampling location moves closer and closer to the building(s) of interest as the signal becomes very ?spikey? in nature, resulting in possible over and underestimations of the viral load if only grab samples are used (Figure 1).   This study also demonstrated that COVID-19 hotspots within a community can be identified by sampling the wastewater from manholes located throughout the community (Figure 2).  In addition, sequencing wastewater samples can be used to accurate identify and quantify the SARS-CoV-2 variant composition in a community at the neighborhood and city scales (Figure 3).  Finally, working with OSU?s TRACE program, which determined community prevalence through random door-to-door nasal swab surveillance, this work demonstrated that wastewater SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations were more accurate than reported COVID-19 cases at predicting the true prevalence of COVID-19 in a community (Figure 4).   These results all show that wastewater surveillance is more reliable and less expensive than traditional COVID-19 surveillance metrics. It has also helped inform the field against the notion that reported COVID-19 cases are a "gold standard" to which we must hold wastewater data accountable.  Instead, this work points out that the known biases and limitations of reported COVID-19 cases (e.g., testing avoidance, limited testing availability, asymptomatic carriers, etc...) are much greater than the biases and limitations of wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. Thus, wastewater could/should be considered the "gold standard" for reporting COVID-19 disease burden in a community and can be highly quantitative (thought to be impossible at the beginning of the pandemic).   In total, this project provided research and participation opportunities to 2 post-docs, 1 MS student and 5 lab/field/bioinformatic technicians.  Of this group, 4 identified as female, 1 as a 1st generation student, 1 as a Navy veteran and 2 as non-white.  Additionally, a total of 23 undergraduates participated in this project helping with wastewater collection, field tracer studies, concentration of samples in the lab and conducting ddPCR assays.  Of this group, 13 identified as female and 13 as non-white.   To date, a total of 8 peer reviewed publications and 1 Masters of Science thesis have been produced from this work.  Over 18 presentations have been made at local, regional and national conferences.  Additionally, results have been communicated to participating municipalities and public health officials through written reports and oral presentations/trainings.  News releases/interviews through newspapers, television, radio and websites were used to inform the general population of ongoing activities and their results.  The results of this project have had important impacts on the fields of public health and infectious disease modeling.  We have been able to leverage the efforts of the NSF RAPID project into a series of wastewater surveillance programs, which has resulted in significant increases and improvements in Oregon State University?s research and data infrastructure surrounding wastewater surveillance.  These programs include a state-wide surveillance program with the Oregon Health Authority, tracking SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B and other selected pathogens at 40 wastewater treatment plants across the state, including two Tribal communities, on a twice weekly schedule.
