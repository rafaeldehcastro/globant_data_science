<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel prosthesis, where discrete, mass-producible modular components can be assembled to fabricate sockets that would otherwise require expensive materials and equipment and hours of custom fitting. The modules can be assembled in virtually limitless configurations and provide a mechanism for conforming to the shape of the individual’s residual limb. This project will also extend a process innovation in the system’s capacity to inexpensively and quickly replace broken components and modify the socket to long-term changes in limb shape, including keeping up with a child's growth or executing complete rebuilds using the same components. The modular design also allows for mass manufacturability of the constituent components rather than specialized one-off manufacturing. The system is suitable for patients of all ages, limb shapes, and for both upper and lower limb sockets, so a broad set of needs can be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to create a universally adjustable, semi-flexible modular socket system that adapts to fluctuations in limb volume and shape changes while still providing a secure and comfortable fit. The modular design enables the product to be assembled, configured, and reconfigured to suit the specific limb shape of the patient. In this project, the implications and limitations of mechanically coupling a distributed, modular, semi-flexible socket system to soft tissues will be explored. This includes maximum and minimum pressure and hotspot mapping under physiologically-relevant loading and torque.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
