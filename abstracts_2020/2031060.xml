<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project uses language documentation methodology to explore effective communication of COVID-19 health-related information to linguistically underserved populations in the US. Such communities may not have access to reliable health information in their native languages. Researchers can translate information from English into other languages, but translation alone cannot ensure information is presented in ways that are culturally appropriate and therefore maximally effective. The future path and possible resurgence of this pandemic remains unknown, so it is critical to learn about group health perceptions and behaviors in order to create best practices for developing critical informational materials for these underserved populations. Scientific investigation of languages for these populations provides the bridge between health information and cultural context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linguists and health information experts will work with a linguistically underserved community to collect personal and group reflections, eliciting highly emotive connected speech on topics rarely collected in language documentation projects. The collected speech samples will potentially include rare vocabulary, idioms, ritual language, songs, and remembered practices that underlie beliefs and motivate health behavior. In-language interviews will be conducted by first-generation native speakers who are undergraduate students and community members. The project will create: (1) video-conferencing technology protocols for language documentation fieldwork; (2) a unique corpus of interlinear glossed texts (personal accounts, interviews, conversations) on health and wellness which can be used in future linguistic research; and (3) increased understanding of health literacy in the community. We aim to contribute to the development of broader best practices for health communication message design to underserved communities, especially during time-sensitive scenarios, as is the case with the current rapidly-changing pandemic. The documentary methods and resulting informational materials can be replicated for other non-English speaking groups within the US and internationally. All materials, including a corpus of interlinear glossed texts, will be archived and publicly-accessible at the University of North Texas Digital Library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF-funded project used language documentation methodologies to explore how to effectively convey COVID-19 health-related information to refugee populations in the US, working with the Chin community of Indiana as a case study. There are hundreds of languages spoken in the United States, and many thousands in the world at large. In a developing health crisis like a pandemic, new informational resources (like FAQs, new laws or policies) may be created rapidly but translated into only a fraction of the world's languages. How, then, do members of linguistically under-served communities gain access to information in a rapidly evolving pandemic? How can information be packaged and distributed in a way that is useful to the community? This project used remote interviews to investigate these questions.</p> <p>The case study is with the Indiana Chin community, 20,000 people who are originally from Chin State in western Burma/Myanmar and speak upwards of 30 languages among them. By developing an increased understanding of Chin perceptions of health and health literacy, the project contributes to the development of broader best practices for <strong>health communication message design</strong>, especially during time-sensitive scenarios such as amid a rapidly-changing pandemic. Interviews were conducted in Hakha Lai (also called Laiholh or Hakha Chin), a language of wider communication for the Chin community both in Burma and in Indianapolis. They were conducted online over Zoom by undergraduate student researchers who are native speakers of Hakha Lai and were trained in interviewing techniques. Recorded interviews were then transcribed and translated by a team of native speaker undergraduate student researchers, using the SIL program SayMore.

Lessons learned from the interviews can inform conversations about public health, conceptualizations of health in the community, experiences with COVID-19, job-related experiences, community support, access to public health information, and many other topics.

Transcribed and translated interviews have been analyzed using SIL's Fieldworks (FLEx) software, which lets researchers annotate language data for linguistic research.

This transferable scientific and practical training can now be used for documentation for linguistic analysis or translations for community purposes.   (3) Disseminated the work at a panel presentation at the 53rd International Conference on Sino-Tibetan Languages and Linguistics which focused on documentary methods, especially those that can be used by the native-speaker linguist, to address the needs of vulnerable populations in situations where there is urgent need for medical and health translation work.  (4) Co-authored, with all student and faculty team members, a chapter about the project to be included in a forthcoming volume on Forced Migration and Education.  (5) Disseminated and discussed findings with local, regional, national, and international audiences.
