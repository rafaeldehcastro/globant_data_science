<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of software to predict spine surgery complications. There are 1.2 million spine surgeries nationally per year and about 25% (300,000 cases) of these are microdiscectomies. The main goal of microdiscectomy is to take pressure off your nerves to relieve back pain. Among spinal surgeries, microdiscectomies are less invasive and have quicker recovery times, however, 5-10% of microdiscectomy patients reherniate leading to additional surgery costs, longer patient recovery times, and lost productivity. Additionally, over 1/3 of reherniations occur within 3 months of the initial operation. To put this in perspective, these patients spend 6 weeks recovering from their first operation only to reherniate within a few months and return to the operating table for a second microdiscectomy or a spinal fusion. These revision surgeries often require months of further recovery time and pain. These secondary surgeries are also challenging for hospitals and insurance companies.  Re-admissions decrease hospital quality ratings, and are often not reimbursed by insurance companies if they happen within 90 days. The proposed technology helps support a reduction in surgical re-admittance by identifying patients likely to reherniate and allowing for risk mediation, saving patients unnecessary pain and reducing hospital costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a machine learning algorithm that uses presurgical data to predict which patients are likely to suffer from recurrent disc herniation following microdiscectomy surgery. This technology aims to reduce the complication rates, thereby increasing patient satisfaction and decreasing costs to the patient and hospital. The machine learning algorithm is capable of correctly identifying 98% of herniation patients as either at risk or not at risk of reherniation in a cohort of 350 patients from one institute. Expansion of this work to multiple institutes is underway. Results have been collected from 1077 patients from 4 institutes in 3 countries thus far, showing that predicted rates of reherniation are higher in reherniated patients; however, the overall percent correct classification is still poor in some institutes because of physician inter-evaluator variability in calculating input metrics from radiographs. The goal is to develop semi-automated image analysis software to calculate input metrics, creating more consistency among institutions. This consistency will make it possible to provide a predictive tool capable of compiling all of the potential risk factors for reherniation and to report a single unified probability of risk so that care decisions are better informed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

We conducted 100 interviews with surgeons, nurses, patients, physicians, chiropractors, hospital administrators, payers, and more during the 10 week course, and dozens more over the following few months. This allowed the Spine by Design team to approach the design and implementation of our surgical decision support software from many angles. Additionally, it allows us to understand the landscape that we will be navigating as we carry our product forward.  Intellectual Merit   Through this project, we were able to confirm the need for our surgical decision support software, as we initially hypothesized, but learned that physician interest is split between technological enthusiasts and traditionalists. We also discovered that our tool may be more interesting to some physicians as an avenue for communication with insurance companies. Further, we discovered some broader interest in our technology as a tool for standardizing spine measurements, allowing more research data pooling, and improving physiciansâ€™ ability to communicate in a common language. This led us to believe that there may be more than one version of our product. During this project, we were also able to identify partners that we would need for commercialization, including insurance companies, hospital IT, and spine device companies. One major technical barrier we identified was the need to integrate seamlessly with the hospital PAC system. This is our priority in the subsequent steps.   Broader Impacts   This project had an impact beyond the intellectual knowledge gained regarding the product. PI and EL received training on how to investigate the potential commercialization of new technology. This has shifted both their approaches to other academic work. Additionally, both the PI and EL gained confidence over the course of this program as they interacted with the industry more broadly. Finally, a clearer business model allowed the PI to obtain additional investment funding for the next steps.          Last Modified: 09/15/2023       Submitted by: Morgan B Giers]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
