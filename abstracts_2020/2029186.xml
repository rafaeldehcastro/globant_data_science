<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[In this project, U.S. and international surveys on COVID-19 are compiled, these materials are made publicly available, and weekly summaries of key research findings are disseminated.  U.S. social science research critically informs government and scientific responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Accurate measurement of the publicâ€™s attitudes and behaviors in the crisis, including its impact on physical and emotional health, economic well-being, and daily activities, is essential in decision making, implementation and assessment.  This project addresses key challenges in advancing this basic knowledge by assembling available survey data from myriad sources; assessing which data are of the necessary quality for use; making these data and associated research materials available to decisionmakers, researchers, and the American public in a highly functional single-source location; summarizing and communicating key findings on an ongoing basis to ensure that important survey findings on COVID-19 are available to the widest possible audience; and doing this all in a highly accelerated time frame.   This resource supports decisionmakers concerning public health and social and economic conditions; assists researchers in their efforts to investigate, analyze and replicate existing studies; and serves the public good by providing open access to COVID-19 social, behavioral, and economic research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses publicly and professionally available sources to compile U.S. and international surveys on COVID-19 and deploys rapid methodological assessments to identify probability-based studies among them.  Producers or sponsors of such surveys are asked to share their topline data reports, scripted questionnaires, datasets, banner books of crosstabulated data, analytical reports and any related analyses and documentation.  All available materials are posted to the open-access Societal Action Experts Network (SEAN) COVID-19 website, making use of the PARC knowledge management platform for survey research. Users can full-text search to retrieve individual survey questions and results, individual scripted questions, and all associated materials.  Weekly summaries of key research findings released in the previous week are produced, linking back to data sources.  These summaries are disseminated to a 1,000+-member email distribution list, the listservs of the American Association for Public Opinion Research and the World Association for Public Opinion Research, SEAN stakeholders, and visitors to the SEAN archive site who sign up for weekly notifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

At last count, the archive included, for example, 1,866 individual questions asking about vaccines and vaccination; 1,110 on concern or worry about various aspects of the pandemic; 677 on testing; 561 on mask wearing or mask policies; 443 on mental health or emotional well-being; 317 on distancing; and so forth.

Sections in one recent typical report included pandemic concerns and outlooks; vaccine uptake and attitudes; safety, masks and misinformation; air travel; vaccine safety and efficacy among children; vaccination during pregnancy; employment; forgone medical care; vaccine lotteries; Omicron severity; and international results.
