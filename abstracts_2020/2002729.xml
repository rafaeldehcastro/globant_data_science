<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[For thousands of years, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NHPI) seafarers have successfully utilized systemic observation of their environment to traverse vast expanses of open ocean and thrive on the most remote islands on earth. Developing NHPI trust in the scientific enterprise requires building connections that bridge the values and concepts of ‘ike kupuna (traditional knowledge) with scientific knowledge systems and contemporary technology. This project will develop and research a pop-up science exhibit that connects indigenous Hawaiian knowledge with contemporary Western science concepts. The exhibit will show how community knowledge (that is consistent with underlying scientific principles and natural laws) has informed innovation by indigenous peoples. This community-initiated and developed project will begin with a single pop-up exhibit designed to incorporate several hands-on culture-based STEM activities that integrate traditional and modern technologies. For example, the exhibit may cover indigenous systems of star navigation for ocean voyaging, systems of netting for food and water containers, or systems of home design with local and natural materials. This project seeks to develop preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of such an approach for supporting rural Hawaiian youths’ STEM engagement, understanding, and personal connections to Native Hawaiian STEM knowledge. Findings from this pilot and feasibility study will inform the development of a larger pop-up science center grounded in indigenous Hawaiian STEM knowledge, and advance intellectual knowledge around culturally sustaining pedagogy by helping informal STEM education practitioners understand community initiated and developed STEM exhibits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pop-up science center pilot will be led by a local Hawaiian community organization, INPEACE, in collaboration with several local community members and other community-based organizations. The preliminary research will iteratively explore whether and how an existing Hawaiian culture-based framework can be used to design hands-on STEM exhibits to enhance rural learner engagement, depth of STEM knowledge, and connection to Native Hawaiian STEM knowledge. Research efforts led by Kamehameha Schools, which has a long history of conducting research from an indigenous worldview, will engage 120 learners from various rural communities across Hawaii, from which 40 will be pre-selected middle-school youth, and 80 individuals will be from public audiences of learners ages 12 and up. Through a series of observations, interviews, pre and post surveys with validated instruments, and focus groups, the research will probe: (1) The learners’ thoughts on the science practice and its relevance to old and new Hawaii and modern society. (2) The level at which related STEM topics have been understood, and (3) The learners’ perceptions about their connection to Native Hawaiian STEM knowledge. Results from this pilot study will inform a future pop-up science center development project, and add to the scarce literature on community-driven, culturally sustaining exhibition development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the NSF Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project, Exploring the Effectivenessf of Community-driven, Culturally Sustaining STEM Exhibit Development was to design, build, and evaluate an exhibit that engages learners in hands-on, exploratory STEM activities that are culture-based, grounded in indigenous Hawaiian knowledge, and integrate both traditional and modern technologies.  Building our exhibit began with the vetting of several ideas collected and refined by the project design team at the Institute for Native Pacific Education and Culture, (INPEACE) and a community advisory committee which included community members, educators, scientist, and project partners. INPEACE then engaged a team of exhibit design experts from Luci Creative to facilitate the design process based on the outcomes of project design meetings.  In year one INPEACE also collaborated with Kamehameha Schools to determine the key data elements for this project and created 3 evaluations based on different participant groups such as community, student or teacher.  Our IRB approval was approved by Pacific Resources for Education and Learning (PREL). As we traveled our Kapa Science Exhibit to communities, we conducted 3 evaluation cycles between December 2021 through March 2022.  The first was the soft launch, by invitation only, at The Community Learning Center at Maili which 35 visitors attended.  This was followed by an official community launch, at the same location, that was attended by 142 visitors. The third cycle was held at Waianae Intermediate School, with 447 students and teachers visiting the exhibit. Each location was well attended and created interest and excitement for the visitors about the science of Kapa.  This project was able to reach over 1,800 visitors as we traveled the exhibit to different communities.  In our targeted groups we were able to receive evaluations and feedback from 376 community learners from different communities such as Waianae, Honolulu, Kaneohe, and Kapolei. Some of the findings included:  90% of our exhibit attendees who completed the survey felt they learned new things about Hawaiian culture and science topics. 94% felt that the exhibit helped them learn about the scientific process involved in kapa making.   82% indicated that the exhibit increased their interest in science.   96% indicated that the exhibit helped them learn more about Hawaiian culture   91% indicated that the exhibit increased their interest in Hawaiian culture.   96% responded that they will either apply what they learned about kapa in the future or continue to seek out new knowledge.   The dissemination report of our projects findings and our learning happened internally in our organization with a presentation given to our design team, key supports and our INPEACE board of directors and an advisory committee made up of community members and educators.  We also presented our findings at the Association for Science and Technology (ASTC) conference in September of 2022 in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.
