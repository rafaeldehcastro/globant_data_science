<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance diagnosis and treatment of walking disorders and associated rehabilitation. An estimated 50 million Americans experience gait (walking) impairment due to injury, disease, and age, and more than 38,800 physical therapy clinics treat these patients. This project will develop an artificial intelligence system to extract gait metrics from video data from cameras surrounding a small area. A new diagnostic tool will track nuanced gait metrics throughout rehabilitation treatment. This technology will enable new and faster ways for physical therapists to precisely diagnose gait abnormalities and track treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project could result in a system to diagnose gait deficiencies for people who suffer from neurological impairments. The proposed project will develop a markerless three-dimensional motion capture system to accurately diagnose gait pathologies in a time- and cost-efficient manner for clinicians. The project will: validate of the markerless motion capture system to ensure accurate measurement of raw kinematic metrics within 10% error of standard methods and potentially expand the system metrics; and conduct verification and validation processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The system was built and compared to a gait laboratory system. The six cameras where installed on tripods and compared to a state of the art Vicon motion camera system.

In contrast, the novel system is markerless and uses computer vision to detect joints from photos of people.&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">As a result of the Phase I research and development the markerless prototype was capable of measuring joint positions within 35 mm of the Vicon system. This project evaluated the novel techniques on five healthy adults and one child subjects to demonstrate feasibility. The resulting joint angles were estimated within 5 degrees. This project demonstrates that simple optical cameras can be used to estimate human pose reasonably accurately.&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed for physical therapists during the Phase I NSF award.
