<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Computer Science has a unique need for teacher professional development (PD) programs, in that many teachers are learning both new content and pedagogy. With the advent of the COVID-19 global pandemic and subsequent US school closures in March of this year, PD providers had to quickly spring into action to create summer PD options that were both professionally rich and safe for participants. Primarily, this has meant a rapid shift from in-person experiences to a range of approaches combining on- and off-line learning environments. In this EAGER led by SageFox Consulting, a lead research partner on several NSF-funded projects, approaches to online PD and its impact on teachers will be documented and disseminated among PD providers. This data will not only inform the content and delivery of PD in the summer of 2021, but will also elucidate methods and mechanisms that may support teachers beyond the pandemic, such as how to reach educators who are the only CS teacher in their school or those who work in remote locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER will capture the unique attributes of the summer of 2020 as many computer science (CS) education professional development (PD) programs move to an all online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic and utilize this data to inform future online PD development. The project team, comprised of SageFox Consulting, CSEdResearch, CRESST, and AIR will leverage their collective evaluation expertise to examine the impact of the forced online delivery of teacher PD by providers either experienced with or new to online PD. Specifically, they aim to understand how projects adapt existing curricula for online learning and how they scale online teacher PD and provide resources within a short timeframe, as well as how their reported data on teacher impact compare to previous years. Gathering lessons learned from this rapid delivery and pedagogical change will help to inform future online PD efforts, especially if COVID 19-related closures continue. In addition, this study may uncover unexpected challenges or benefits associated with online PD (e.g., how to build community in an online space versus in person, ability to recruit participants from broader geographic areas). The central research questions for this project are: 1) What curricular and pedagogical changes have been made to summer 2020 CS PD in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and what was the process for making these changes? 2) What does teacher engagement look like in online CS PD and how is it measured? 3) In what ways has the move to online CS PD impacted participants in areas such as self-efficacy and perceived learning? 4 )How can lessons learned from summer 2020 PD inform future PD efforts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The shift toward virtual PD delivery models necessitated rethinking PD design, rollout, and assessment. We administered a comprehensive survey to 29 providers, conducted three case studies, and interviews in Summer and Fall 2021 to document the lasting impacts of Covid-19 on CSPD offerings. We shared what we learned through academic papers, webinars, a comprehensive report, virtual CSPD guidebook, and a CSPD evaluation toolkit. Summary findings are provided below: PLANNING FOR PD  Schedule. Providers revised their PD schedules, exploring overall duration, the balance of synchronous and asynchronous activities, tool selection, the inclusion of physical computing experiences, and the accessibility and logistics of physical materials.  Tools. Two practices that helped to smooth the use of third-party tools include having a dedicated technical support facilitator during the PD to respond to technical help questions and holding pre-PD tool orientation sessions designed to free PD time for instructional content by working with teachers to set up accounts, install software, and become familiar with the PD tools before the PD began. Incentives. Since 2020 programs did not involve housing or travel costs, many providers re-allocated their budget. Some programs chose to reduce or eliminate registration fees. A common incentive provided related to professional credits. Of the 23 programs reporting their incentive strategies, 76% of them offered some kind of credential to teachers in 2020.  Facilitators and facilitator training. Some facilitators were part of the core programmatic team that developed the summer 2020 PD and therefore did not require separate facilitator training. Many facilitators were themselves CS teachers trained through the PD program in past years. Projects training new facilitators focused on techniques for virtual PD, such as how to combat video call fatigue and how to use technology, including navigating the platform and organizing materials in the LMS.  Other examples of changes to PD implementation included creating videos of difficult concepts for teachers, reviewing modules to ensure they would work remotely, and having facilitators script their content delivery. Multiple providers reported that facilitators wanted more preparation for best practices in online instruction and that facilitators would have preferred more practice with the tools. Other providers realized that they needed more facilitators; for example, one facilitator was needed to monitor the chat during synchronous meetings while the other presented the content. Challenges with virtual PD were mitigated by high levels of collaboration and support between facilitators. DELIVERING CONTENT As reported by the providers, PD delivery was dependent on the choices made prior to PD around scheduling, LMS tools, and facilitator training, as well as the goals and objectives for the PD as they related to teacher knowledge and skills. Many of the providers modeled pedagogy for offering CS instruction online in anticipation of a virtual or hybrid academic year with an emphasis on facilitating discussions and conducting ongoing assessments.  Providers recognized that participants missed opportunities to interact in person, yet also highlighted ways they worked virtually to build community among participants. One provider noted during a follow-up conversation, ?We found that creating community ahead of our PD was important! We began hosting ?Coffee and CS Ed? Zoom check-in calls weekly on Fridays when the pandemic began and felt that the network from those calls and the structure of coming together for conversation, collaboration, and troubleshooting helped to set the stage for success in our virtual summer PD sessions.?  EVALUATING PD We asked each provider what data they collected as part of their process among seven common constructs for teacher PD: program satisfaction, self-efficacy, content knowledge (self-reported and assessed), pedagogical content knowledge (self-reported and assessed), and interest in teaching CS (McGill et al. 2021). Nine of the 29 PD providers (31%) did not report collecting any data related to these constructs, while 16 (55%) collected data related to program satisfaction. Self-efficacy data were collected by 8 of the twenty-nine (28%) programs, and interest in teaching CS data were collected by five (17%) of these providers.  The move to virtual PD had little perceived impact on the growth of participants; however, given the limited data, we considered this result unrepresentative across the entire set of providers for our study. Three things we learned from our follow-up   Teacher engagement in PD is down (as of summer/fall 2021) PD assessments are essential PD-based teacher communities are becoming regional/national in focus, and less localized  Four Ways PD is Becoming More Customized   On-demand or just-in-time PD is needed.  PD is increasingly adaptive to the experience level of the teachers. PD providers are prioritizing offerings based on enrollment. Virtual PD has shifted the business model. Providers that historically cultivate locally-offered PD through partners (for example, a regional hub or a district) are now offering PD through the PD provider?s main site.
