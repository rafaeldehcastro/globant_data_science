<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This research will examine how norms are maintained and how they change, a poorly understood phenomenon that is key to explaining human social evolution and contemporary cultural change. Its findings will shed light on how people make decisions in normative contexts, and what factors determine whether and how a norm changes under new social, economic, environmental or political forces. The findings will be disseminated widely through web forms, news reports and outreach events. In addition, the research will strengthen the STEM workforce and research infrastructure, and will provide training to U.S.-based graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines how a surplus division norm from cooperative farming is maintained despite preferences against the norm. The norm specifies that households that cooperate in farming should divide the gains equally by household, regardless of the relative land and labor contribution. Data will be collected through 1) surveys to document people’s farming practices, 2) vignettes to elicit normative attitudes and preferences on cooperative farming arrangements, and 3) recordings of each household’s daily activity and goods flow. The data will be analyzed with multinomial logit models to identify how individuals acquire private preferences about what to do when social pressure is absent, how they determine the optimal choice when social pressure is present, and how such normative decision algorithms lead to the observed behaviors. The data and analyses are designed to pinpoint individual decision-making algorithms and allow for tests of normative shift models. By developing fieldwork-compatible methodologies to measure all the elements of a norm at the same time and study the norm as a complex system, the research advances the use of holistic frameworks to examine norm stasis and change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During March 2020 to January 2021, the Co-PI interviewed Derung villagers about their farming practices and documented their daily activities and goods flow to study how individuals in small-scale subsistence societies make normative decisions. In Derung village D (Yunnan, China), the traditional norm that "households farming together should divide the gains equally by household, regardless of labor and land contribution" was followed in 95% of the subsistence crop co-farming partnerships. However, most subjects reported preferring labor-based division and expecting other villagers to prefer labor-based division. Instead, the "equal division by household norm" is maintained by people’s strong tendency to follow traditions and copy others’ behaviors and the cultural interpretation that dividing equally by household indicates a strong bond between the partners. This suggests that to understand normative behaviors, we need to go beyond the rationality framework, which claims people decide whether to comply with a norm based on material payoffs, normative preferences and social consequences calculated from others’ attitudes. A second significant finding is that individuals acquire their normative preferences about the best division rule mainly from their social network, further confirming that compared to social approval, material payoffs are not a critical motivator in Derung people’s social life. These findings have been reported in the 2021 HBES conference and to researchers in the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.     In addition to forming an empirically-based scientific understanding of how individuals make decisions in a normative context, this project developed field-compatible methods of measuring normative behaviors and attitudes on the individual level, constructed two data sets that can shed light on human cooperation, established a field site with trained research assistants that can be readily used for other projects. It advanced the scholarly ties and collaborative opportunities between the US, Germany and China through the Co-PI’s visits to academic institutions in Germany and China and her communications with the researchers there. It also strengthened the STEM workforce in the US by contributing data to the Co-PI’s dissertation and providing research experience to two undergraduate research assistants.     For the study community, this project encouraged Derung villagers to talk about their traditions, values, and tales, both with the Co-PI and with each other, and thus promoted cultural awareness, preservation, and education. The Co-PI contributed her free time in the field to building an information and social networking infrastructure, through which interested villagers can receive information about market status and strategies, interpretations of medical information, and advice on adult education opportunities. Such an infrastructure significantly increases the bargaining power of Derung individuals in the new market economy they are trying to adapt to.
