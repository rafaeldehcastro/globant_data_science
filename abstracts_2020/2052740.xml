<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The main scientific goal of this project is to study the interplay between certain nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) and the natural progenitor particle systems from which these equations are derived. The equations considered are fundamental models for wave propagation phenomena ranging from the microscopic (Bose Einstein Condensate) to the macroscopic (rogue waves in deep sea), and for the dynamics of gases (Vlasov equation). To address important challenges in studying these equations, the PIs adopt an innovative approach combining deterministic and probabilistic perspectives. Informed by the qualitative properties of these PDE, the principal objective of this project is to identify the correct analogues of such properties at the many particle level, and to demonstrate that these correspond to the known properties at the PDE level. The award will foster collaborations among US based researchers at various stages of their careers and provide research opportunities and support for students and postdoctoral scholars. Additional activities include three annual research workshops aimed at training, dissemination, and stimulate further research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their analysis, the PIs consider two different but intimately related research directions at the forefront of mathematical physics, nonlinear PDE and probability. The first direction concerns the derivation of the Hamiltonian structure for nonlinear evolution equations, including kinetic equations such as the Vlasov equation, as well as a novel viewpoint on such derivations guided by Ebin-Marsden's seminal program in the context of hydrodynamics. The second direction is rooted on the integrability of the 1D cubic nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation and pursues two lines of inquiry. One of these questions focuses on exploring the origins of integrability of the 1D cubic NLS through a series of projects aimed at unveiling correct analogues of integrability at the many particle level, and then at demonstrating that these correspond to the known properties at the NLS level. A second line of inquiry stems from the work of Lebowitz, Rose and Speer who posited that the grand canonical ensemble description of equilibrium behavior is expected to be false for integrable PDE. The PIs plan to settle this major open problem by constructing a suitable substitute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
