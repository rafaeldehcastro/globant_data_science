<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel on-board sensor for detecting oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in diesel exhaust streams with a sensitivity and specificity unmet by existing technologies. Diesel engine manufacturers currently cannot accurately precisely control their exhaust systems due to the lack of appropriate cost-effective sensors capable of differentiating between NOx and other species in the exhaust stream. The proposed sensor can result in 10% fuel efficiency improvements.  Use of this sensor at scale will lead to reduced carbon emissions and healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level ozone, and acid rain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is based on a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which probes the unique spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-species interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower detection thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the harsh high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments in a form factor similar to those of existing diesel aftertreatment systems. This Phase I research will leverage novel manufacturing techniques to fabricate and demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity laser-based sensor capable of surviving high-temperature, oxidizing, intensely vibrating, and particulate-laden flows characteristic of vehicle exhaust gases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
