<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the increased likelihood of effective and affordable new antibody therapy development for COVID-19 and other diseases. Current software is time-intensive to advance antibody therapy development. The proposed software will provide rapid, accurate information about the function and safety of putative therapies, enabling faster deployment. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will develop novel algorithms and interfaces for enhancing antibody analysis via mass spectrometry. The research will expand capacity and accuracy for detecting, characterizing, and quantifying antibody glycans, disulfide bonds, and impurities by capturing information from experimental metadata, sample preparation, instrument parameters, and instrument output and creating models for prediction of possible structures supported by the data. The proposed project aims to increase the quantity of antibody subunits that can be accurately detected and quantified. This process will take tenfold less time than current methods through the use of novel algorithms, customizable automatable processes, and integrated reporting tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The COVID pandemic exposed limitations in the development times required to discover and bring to market treatments for novel disease. Much of the time required in these processes stems from the difficulty of measuring the properties and effects of candidate molecules. Mass spectrometry is one of the primary analytical techniques for measuring molecular candidates.  Because mass spectrometry is used so heavily throughout the discovery, safety testing, and manufacturing of drugs and therapies for treating disease, innovations in mass spectrometry data processing have the potential to radically increase the speed with which new innovations can be discovered and publicly made available.  Mass spectrometry can quickly produce large volumes of data, but requires complex computational analysis in order to render experimental data into human-readable results. At present, researchers spend more than half their time creating and producing data analysis results rather than designing and running new experiments.  Through leveraging high-performance computing, advanced algorithms, and innovative and intuitive custom interactive dashboards, we have produced new approaches to several key tasks required for mass spectrometry analysis, yielding better results in about a tenth of the previously required time.   In this research, we created a novel approach to identifying glycans?an important type of molecule in the design and manufacture of new antibody therapies?that allows users to identify and quantify glycans in an experiment in an order of magnitude less time than present methods. Among these contributions, we: (1) designed a novel algorithm to match compounds between experiments which outperformed all tested existing methods, (2) created a means of easily and flexibly evaluating relative differences between experiments, and (3) implemented a means of stratifying identifications of a given molecule across variations of the molecule. These innovations have been integrated in Prometheus, our flagship software product, where it will be used in academic and industry labs to create and advance treatments for novel disease.
