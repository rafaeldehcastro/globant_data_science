<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project examines diffusion of rumors and misinformation during unrest. The context is a large city where the COVID-19 outbreak has happened amid a large-scale collective action.  By empirically examining how falsehoods feed and are fed by collective behaviors in this situation, the project aims to understand how misinformation and rumors both online and offline co-evolve during a period of unrest. Understanding rumor diffusion during unrest contributes to identifying challenges for consensus building in contemporary communication ecology. By studying rumor diffusion in a large-scale context, the study adds value in knowing how authorities use misinformation. The project will have impact on training of future practitioners in terms of how to deal with news about unrest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research questions concern variation in rumors, misinformation, and the sharing of these; interpolation of COVID-19 rumors into collective action narratives; differences in the patterns of rumors and rumor-debunking messages; and the association between beliefs in misinformation and participation in collective action.  Two methodological approaches are taken. First, string-matching techniques are employed to identify rumors and rumor-debunking messages from a large corpus of digital data, crawled from social media platforms. Computational methods including structural topic modeling and diffusion tree network analysis are used to infer coherent themes across rumor messages and to examine rumor diffusion patterns in terms of depth, width, and interlayer ratios. Second, online surveys are conducted in both regions using a stratified sample of about 1,500 anonymous participants. Regression modeling is performed to understand relationships among beliefs in different types of rumors, institutional trust, and protest support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project is to understand how rumors are propagated in time of crisis such as political crisis like Hong Kong Protest and health crisis like COVID-19. The goal is to advance theories of social movement and rumor psychology in recent digital misinformation ecosystem. The project employed an interdisciplinary approach with mixed methods including computational analyses of digital trace data and survey data analyses. Through multiple publications, the project made theoretical advancements in rumor research. Specifically, in the context of COVID-19, the project tested how the perception of different types of threats induced by the crisis made people engage into rumor-milling (see Image 4). The project also traced a year-long twitter conversation surrounding a COVID-19 conspiracy theory, showing how conspiratorial narratives evolve as a collective crisis-sensemaking process (see Image 2 and 3). In the context of China/Hong Kong, the project demonstrated what types of rumors were spread during political unrest and how such rumors function as a trigger ?or suppressor -- of protest support (Image 1 and 5). Broadening the scope of digital social interactions to investigate, the project also introduced to a mechanism of online offensive speech contagion as a spillover impact of enduring political unrests in Hong Kong (Image 6).</p> <p>This project informs the public how digital rumors can influence public understanding and management of crisis. By examining both the U.S. and China-Hong Kong social contexts, this project added value in understanding how foreign governments go about using misinformation. The project supported graduate students from the communities of colors and educated future journalists by introducing findings of this research to journalism major students via seminar and teaching. The project?s findings were disseminated through multiple conference presentations and academic journal articles. Importantly, the project published a public-facing article to educate broader public about disinformation/misinformation in non-western world, the excerpts of which were selected for use in upcoming Middle School Social Studies Multi-Course program by a widely known book publisher, McGraw Hill.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/29/2023<br>      Modified by: Kyounghee&nbsp;Kwon</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2027387/2027387_10663676_1675017339121_textnetfigure--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2027387/2027387_10663676_1675017339121_textnetfigure--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Network visualization of keywords that frequently appeared in the collected rumor stories"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2027387/2027387_10663676_1675017339121_textnetfigure--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Network visualization of keywords that frequently appeared in the collected rumor stories"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">It illustrates semantic connections of keywords representing protest-related rumors emerged from Hong Kong citizens' word-of-mouth, such as stories around anti-activists, abusive authoritarianism, covert operation, rape by police, assaulted journalist, and mysterious suicide cases.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hazel Kwon</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kyounghee&nbsp;Kwon</div> <div class="imageTitle">Network visualization of keywords that frequently appeared in the collected rumor stories</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2027387/2027387_10663676_1675013455666_Figure1-volume--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2027387/2027387_10663676_1675013455666_Figure1-volume--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Weekly volume of tweets about Bill Gates conspiracy theory"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2027387/2027387_10663676_1675013455666_Figure1-volume--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Weekly volume of tweets about Bill Gates conspiracy theory"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Twitter data was collected in realtime using the streaming API from 3/31/2020 (WHO's declaration of global pandemic) to 12/31/2020.
