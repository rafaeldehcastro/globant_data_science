<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Boundaries between groups break down when couples marry across different cultural, ethnic and/or religious affiliations. This has consequences on couples, their families, and inter-community relationships. Intermarriage may provide access to new resources and social networks, but may also involve costs such as social stigma and loss of support in the natal community. This doctoral dissertation project explores the drivers of and impediments to intermarriage at the individual, household, and community levels in order to deepen our understanding of how contemporary heterogeneous societies take shape, as well as the effects of community heterogeneity on social networks and resilience to resource shortfalls. The project will train a graduate student and other field researchers in anthropological and sociological data collection and analysis; results will be disseminated widely to participant communities, academics, and the broader public.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The researchers will carry out the study in two neighboring multi-ethnic communities whose economies rely extensively on small-scale commercial horticulture. Using data on community membersâ€™ social ties, economic diversification, and cultural beliefs about neighboring ethnic groups, the researchers will analyze what factors predict intermarriage and test the extent to which intermarriage bridges social divides between community members. This study will help inform longstanding debates in anthropology surrounding how kinship structures form, and the effects of intergroup cooperation on resilience in the face of resource shortfalls. This research will also serve as a case study for social scientists studying the impacts of migration and cultural pluralism on cultural identities and ethnic conflicts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intermarriage is a primary driver of gene flow and cultural exchange in our species. In contemporary industrialized and globalized societies, widespread intermarriage between individuals from different ethnic and/or religious backgrounds is primarily understood as a by-product of successful minority integration and fading group boundaries. However, intermarriage can also cause boundaries between groups to break down, with important consequences for couples, their families, and inter-community relationships. This doctoral dissertation project explores the drivers and consequences of intermarriage at the individual, household, and community levels in order to deepen our understanding of how contemporary heterogeneous societies take shape, as well as the effects of community heterogeneity on social networks and resilience to resource shortfalls. This research takes place in the context of a multiethnic village located at the intersection of the Amazon and the Andean highlands of Bolivia, where resource access and production strategies vary between indigenous Moseten and first- or second-generation Aymara-Quechua Highlander migrants.</p> <p>First, we find ethnicity is an important factor in the choice of marriage partners and marital stability, with a higher risk of divorce for intermarried couples. Further, intermarriage between Moseten women and Highlander men may be driven by socioeconomic resource exchanges, whereby Moseten women leverage their privileged access to arable land in tribal territory to attract wealthier Highlander men. Secondly, we leverage a localized crop failure event to investigate whether interethnic marriage fulfills a risk management function. We find that intermarried Moseten-Highlander couples are better able to recover from the economic impacts of crop failure relative to Moseten-Moseten couples, but not relative to Highlander-Highlander couples. Their greater resilience is likely due to more diverse production strategies and reliance on remittances from larger extra-community social support networks. Thirdly, we investigate how the presence of intermarried couples and their progeny, being of mixed ethnicity, affects the community?s social networks, attitudes towards diversity, and the salience of ethnic identities. We find intermarried individuals to be well-integrated into the study community?s networks and act as bridges between different ethnic groups. Although these findings suggest positive effects of intermarriage as a potential accelerator of integration, we find mixed effects on its potential to erode negative attitudes between groups.</p> <p>&nbsp;In sum, this dissertation suggests that resource exchange and risk buffering may, at least in part, drive intermarriage in multicultural societies where resource access, production strategies and social networks vary between groups. Accordingly, intermarriage may be tolerated and widespread even in contexts where markers of group identity, such as ethnicity, remain important factors in the choice of marriage partners. While a scarcity of marriage partners resulting from small ingroup size or a disparity in the number of men and women can lead to the abrupt adoption of norms favoring intermarriage as a fallback strategy, the potential advantage intermarriage confers by providing access to resources and/or buffering risk under conditions of greater ecological uncertainty may lead to a more organic (and perhaps more stable over time) endorsement of norms favoring intermarriage.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/20/2022<br>      Modified by: Sarah&nbsp;Alami Gouraftei</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2017527/2017527_10698909_1671543088710_photo5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2017527/2017527_10698909_1671543088710_photo5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Intermarriage and intergroup relationships"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2017527/2017527_10698909_1671543088710_photo5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Intermarriage and intergroup relationships"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(A) Intermarried individuals are more likely to act as bridges between different ethnic clusters  in the community social networks.
