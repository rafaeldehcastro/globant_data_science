<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will focus on the impacts of flooding and debris flows on the landforms and physical functioning of the estuary of Scott Creek, California after wildfire. The Scott Creek watershed almost completely burned in the August, 2020 CZU Lightning Complex Fire, and in the recent past the estuary has experienced dramatic changes from direct human management and sea-level rise. Because fire has destabilized hillslopes and increased the production of runoff, Scott Creek will likely flood its estuary with water and sediment during even relatively minor storm events. Mountainous coastal regions prone to wildfire, such as those of the US Pacific Coast, are also concentrations of human lives, infrastructure and economic importance. Better understanding of the processes controlling the impacts of debris flows on coastal systems after wildfire is critical to informing effective management and restoration of these systems in the context of previous human modification and sea-level rise. The scientific advances from this project will also inform hazard management for the protection of human health and prosperity in coastal regions impacted by wildfire. This work is conducted by a research group dedicated to creating opportunities for underrepresented groups in the geosciences, which will be advanced through this projectâ€™s conduct, future analysis of resultant datasets with additional early career scientists, and incorporation of results into educational materials at the University of California, Riverside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide urgently needed, perishable data supporting a novel opportunity to investigate the impacts of wildfire on landform change in the Scott Creek watershed. Surveying and sampling will be conducted before and after each rainstorm or rainstorm cluster during the 2021 wet season. The ground surface of the estuary, both above and below standing water, will be surveyed using high resolution laser scanning and echo sounder techniques, respectively. Sediment and water samples will also be collected from locations throughout the estuary and investigated for physical and chemical characteristics that provide information about sediment source and hydrodynamic transport conditions. These data will be leveraged into a more comprehensive study of longer term (multi-year) geomorphic and ecological changes in the estuary following the fire with a focus on the processes contributing to the development of landforms and sediment deposits, and their impacts on physical and ecological function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported a RAPID surveying and monitoring campaign to investigate geomorphic change in the estuary of Scott Creek, California over the course of the 2021 water year (Figure 1). The Scott Creek watershed almost completely burned in the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex Fire, rendering it highly prone to debris flow and debris floods over the rapidly approaching wet season. This monitoring project provided urgently needed, perishable data supporting a novel opportunity to investigate the impacts of wildfire on geomorphic change, including the evolution of sediment sources, in the estuary of a small mountainous river in the context of documented changes wrought by human management and sea level rise. The data and samples collected during this project will be leveraged into a more comprehensive study of longer term (multi-year) geomorphic and ecological changes in the estuary following the fire in service of the following research questions: 1) How does post-fire sediment transfer impact estuarine geomorphology and stratigraphy over event to interannual time scales? 2) What are the dominant processes that contribute to these geomorphic and sedimentological changes? 3) How do changes in sediment source translate to changes in post-fire estuarine sediment deposits and 4) What are the implications of these changes for the hydro-sedimentological and ecological function of the estuary over the post-fire season and beyond?</p> <p>The need for immediate surveying and monitoring operations to approach these questions (particularly 1-3) was extremely urgent. With RAPID funding we were able to monitor sedimentation and geomorphic change in the estuary over the course of the2021 wet season (Figure 1). Initial high-resolution (sub-cm to cm scale) topographic/bathymetric surveys and installation of hydro-sedimentological monitoring infrastructure were conducted before the onset of the 2020/21 wet season, and then revisited at the end of the 2021 wet season. Terrestrial laser scanning was used to survey &lsquo;dry&rsquo; estuary surfaces (Figure 2), and single-beam sonar and real time kinematic GPS was used to survey inundated portions of the estuary, including the lower Scott Creek Channel (Figure 3). A total of 14 sediment and surface water monitoring sites were installed throughout the estuary, most of which included feldspar layers and sedimentation tiles for monitoring and sampling sediment deposited during the 2021 season, as well as siphon-based water samplers (Figure 4). Additionally, three water level loggers were installed on the northern and southern marsh platforms, and in the lower Scott Creek Channel, along with an automated water sampler that unfortunately experienced a technical failure and failed to sample (Figure 5). Imagery of estuary inundation was collected during portions of the 2020/21 wet season from an adjacent hillside, where rain fall was also monitored (Figure 6).</p> <p>The data from the proposed RAPID monitoring project will be used to improve fundamental understanding of post-fire sediment transfer impacts on estuarine systems. High resolution topographic change detection has revolutionized the study of post-fire sediment transfer processes in headlands. Change detection coupled with hydro-sedimentological monitoring and sampling will provide valuable insights into the processes responsible for the spatiotemporal distribution of sediment deposition and sourcing, the development of stratigraphic characteristics, and how channel change (i.e. aggradation, scour, meander, and avulsion) impact sediment transfer. We expect study data will contribute to our research group&rsquo;s efforts to refine conceptual models of estuarine hydro-sedimentological disturbance response.</p> <p>The broader impacts of the proposed research are twofold. First, it enhance integrated earth systems education and professional training for groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The PI is committed to actively increasing diversity in the Geosciences. Two of the three junior members of the monitoring team were underrepresented minorities, including a Latina undergraduate student. The PI will explicitly incorporate data from this project into his course material at the University of California, Riverside.</p> <p>Second, the date collected through this monitoring campaign will be valuable for local and regional estuarine restoration and management, particularly the planned Scott Creek Lagoon and Marsh Restoration Project, supported by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department Transportation, with partners at the Santa Cruz County RCD (SCCRCD), and Environmental Science Associates (ESA). This monitoring project benefitted from previous marsh platform, channel bathymetry, sedimentological and ecological characterization, as well as ongoing hydrologic and estuary mouth migration/closure monitoring performed for the restoration project. The results of our proposed work will provide valuable and timely information on post-fire geomorphic, hydrologic and sedimentological change in this estuary and others. The results of this study will also be published in a peer reviewed journal article.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/08/2021<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;B&nbsp;Gray</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638989950815_FIG1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638989950815_FIG1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638989950815_FIG1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The study region and an illustration of the monitoring plan for the Scott Creek estuary, CA.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andrew Gray</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;B&nbsp;Gray</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638989060597_Fig2_TLS--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638989060597_Fig2_TLS--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638989060597_Fig2_TLS--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Surveying the marsh platform with a terrestrial laser scanner.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andrew Gray</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;B&nbsp;Gray</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638989124057_Fig3_sonar-bathy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638989124057_Fig3_sonar-bathy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638989124057_Fig3_sonar-bathy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bathymetric surveying lower Scott Creek with a single beam echo sounder.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andrew Gray</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;B&nbsp;Gray</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638990301659_Fig4_Samping-all--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638990301659_Fig4_Samping-all--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2055100/2055100_10708143_1638990301659_Fig4_Samping-all--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A.
