<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment on R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 168â€™ general purpose research vessel owned and operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the United States Academic Research Fleet (ARF).  BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for-profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the Island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but specifically work in support of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series (BATS) program. RV Atlantic Explorer had 186 days funded in 2019, all but 6 of which were for NSF. In 2020, the vessel is scheduled to sail 192 days with 156 (81%) of them funded by NSF. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refurbish Markey DESH 5 Winch S/N: 13790 $338,208&lt;br/&gt;Purchase one Hawboldt Standard Winch 42 Series $415,612&lt;br/&gt;      $753,820&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The refurbishment of the DUSH 5 Markey winch for the R/V Atlantic Explorer has been completed, and both have been installed and working on the ship since the 2022 shipyard. The new winch is working a lot better than the one that it has replaced. Winch operators have much better control of the winch with regards to finer movements of the winch which is leading to smoother and safer operations. All ABs were directly trained with hands on experience operating the winch from the doghouse and the bridge. The new winch and level rewind have been in continual use since their installation on the R/V Atlantic Explorer and substantially added the sampling and recovery of a multitude of seawater samples subsequently analysed for physical, biological and biogeochemical properties.  The level rewind was also included in the installation of the DUSH 5 Markey winch for the R/V Atlantic Explorer.  The acquistion of the DUSH 5 Markey winch and the level rewind has improved the ocean going capability of the R/V Atlantic Explorer and skillsets/experience of most of the crew.   The SSSE 2020 award has not contributed directly to the development of science and marine operations, but substantially improved the capability of ship operations at sea.
