<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This MRS Symposium will focus on current and emerging strategies for bioinspired synthesis and manufacturing of materials. Over the past 3 decades, biological materials have been an area of intense study owing to their precise control over molecular chemistry and hierarchical assembly that gives rise to unique emergent properties. Tremendous progress has been made to understand the structure-property relationships within such materials; however, production at scale remains a critical challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
