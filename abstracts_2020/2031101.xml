<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Many significant social decisions are made in situations of high uncertainty. A personâ€™s ability to resolve such uncertainty can have profound implications for outcomes ranging from health to work performance.  Past research has shown that people exhibit reliable tendencies to respond to uncertainty with either positive or negative emotions.  These personal biases play a significant role in responding well or poorly to high uncertainty. This project leverages the urgent opportunity presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to advance the understanding of individual-level biases in the context of a societal-level stressor.  Very little is currently known about the effects of societal-level stressors, such as a global pandemic, on individual-level trait-like biases.  The negative thoughts and feelings some individuals experience in response to extreme societal uncertainty can have deleterious outcomes on health, work performance, and relationships.  This project lays the foundation for developing interventions to disrupt these maladaptive processes in favor of more productive responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An online study includes three distinct measures of valence bias (the tendency to ascribe uncertainty with a negative meaning).  Measures of mood/temperament, resilience, and social factors likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., loneliness) are collected.  A subset of participants in the study completed the valence bias tasks before the pandemic (Wave 1).  In a longitudinal design, these same participants will be re-assessed at the height of the pandemic (Wave 2) and again after the pandemic ends (Wave 3).  By following people over time, it is possible to gauge the effects associated with a greater increase in negativity as a function of the global pandemic, as well as greater recovery after it ends.  A new group of participants will be added at Waves 2 and 3 to provide additional data for a cross-sectional exploration of the mechanisms that predict individual differences in valence bias at each time point. Age-related effects will also be explored at each wave. The research considers how people can learn to "do it better" to increase well-being and resilience in response to societal threats and uncertainty. The findings will shed light on how some individuals are able to override stress-related increases in negativity and instead resolve uncertainty in a positive light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
