<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The project will develop new artificial intelligence (AI) methods to augment the productivity of biomedical researchers and accelerate scientific discovery in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will issue weekly updates to our widely-used Cord-19 and SciSight resources, which are a critical resource for researchers studying SARS-CoV-2, having already been downloaded over 100,000 times by other researchers. We will also extend these resources to make them more useful to doctors and researchers in two ways. First, we will automatically generate one-sentence summaries of each paper to speed sensemaking of the rapidly changing literature. Second, we will automatically extract a broad range of entities (such as disease symptoms and research challenges) and relations to improve filtering and search. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to generate one-sentence summaries of research papers, we will train an abstractive BART model, using two novel techniques: 1) co-training on the auxiliary task of title prediction, and 2) fine-tuning using a set of one-sentence summaries that we will generate by crowd-sourcing edits peer-review comments taken from sites such as OpenReview. We will test our one-sentence summary generation with a combination of automated (Rouge) metrics and user preference. In order to increase the number of entities and relations extracted from research papers, we will bootstrap with data-programming techniques then apply graph-neural-network methods. We will evaluate our progress using a combination of expert-annotated data and held out information from relevant knowledge bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed new artificial intelligence powered tools to help accelerate scientific discovery in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. We focused on two specific tasks that will benefit both scientists and MDs: summarization of research papers and knowledge graph construction from scientific text, as described below.      Extreme Summarization of Scientific Documents  We introduced the task of  `TLDR generation’ -  a new form of extreme summarization, for scientific papers. (The acronym TLDR stands for `too long; didn’t read.’) TLDR generation involves creating a 15-25 word summary of a research paper that captures the most important elements of the research: why it’s important, what is novel, how the research was performed, and how the results were evaluated. Creating a good TLDR is hard, because it involves high source compression and requires expert background knowledge and understanding of complex domain-specific language. After specifying the task of TLDR generation, we created a dataset of example paper/TLDR pairs. We then developed a novel AI system using neural networks and used machine learning to train the network to perform the task. We show that our method performs well and distribute both data and code as open-source for the community.      Extracting a Knowledge Base of Mechanisms from COVID-19 Papers  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the publication of hundreds of thousands of research papers on related viruses. This explosion of papers makes it hard or impossible for scientists to read or even skim summaries of all potentially relevant papers. In response, our project has developed methods for building a symbolic representation of the results described in these papers, called a knowledge base.
