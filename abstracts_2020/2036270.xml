<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly improve the ability to generate biological pharmaceuticals. The biopharmaceutical industry is working to grow specific genetically engineered microbial cells that will produce a vaccine, injectable protein, or other products. There is a pressing need to culture unique microbes, starting from small scale batches, that rapidly scale to commercially viable batch sizes with high product output. A pressurized horizontal fermentor supports the industryâ€™s drive towards single-use bags for microbial fermentation, as single-use fermentors lower operating costs and reduce cross-contamination that can result in loss of an entire batch. This scalable, single-use fermentor should achieve higher yields and allow drug producers to produce kilogram quantities of protein in a more cost-effective manner. This innovative, flexible, pressurizable, horizontal modular design will decrease time-to-market for vaccines, therapeutic proteins or other microbially manufactured products, from both small and large biologics producers, to combat global infectious, and other diseases, at reduced operating costs, saving lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance the knowledge of how microbial cells are cultivated in a horizontal, pressurized single-use bag fermentor. The knowledge gained will validate microbial production using a modular design that provides flexibility to adjust the capacity of the system, without significant facility modifications or cost.  An initial prototype demonstrated highly encouraging results regarding fast mixing times, proper scalable power input, and excellent oxygen mass transfer.  The design to be refined here has the potential to transform the biologics manufacturing industry by impacting the ability to generate high cell densities and reduce the cost of microbial manufacturing. Research objectives are to demonstrate: a fully developed design with the heat removal capacity required of high cell density fermentation (currently unachievable using existing industry vertical single-use fermentor designs); a pressurized bag system that can achieve oxygen transfer rates needed for high density cultures; and a scalable format that allows for rapid scaling to 3000 liters.  A fully functioning test fermentor will be built and evaluated using both computational fluid dynamics analysis and laboratory testing of culture conditions. Experimental work will evaluate high agitation impellers, high gas flows, gas sparger designs, and system structural elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[New Horizon Biotech, Inc. (NHB), seeks to disrupt a conservative industry by innovating the way an essential class of worldwide products are produced, making drugs more rapidly and widely available, in a more sustainable way with single-use (SU) bioprocess equipment. NHB's novel approach challenges the biopharmaceutical industry's conventional development and production methods. This industry conventionally manufactures in product-specific, dedicated facilities. Expanding drug production capacity means more and larger facilities, requiring more land and resources. Moreover, conventional production equipment, specifically fermentors and bioreactors, grow larger, vertically, within the facility, to meet production volume. Like facilities, the equipment is custom designed and built. Cleaning the equipment between drug batches consumes vast amounts of water. The complexity associated with such facility construction and the bespoke nature of such equipment is engineering-, construction-, and, ultimately, time-intensive thus limiting the ability to reproducibly distribute manufacturing globally ? for example ? in the face of regional, or global pandemics. NHB?s bioprocess equipment product design literally turns conventional thinking on its side, by re-imaging volumetric production expansion using horizontally oriented bioreactors and fermentors (Figure 1) instead of maintaining the vertical paradigm. With equipment oriented horizontally, it can be modularized and, thereby, standardized. Standardization is further achieved by adapting highly engineered polymers and components into a disposable culture bag pressurized vessel (Figure 2) where bulk drug product is produced. The biopharmaceutical industry has already embraced this disposable concept, known as single-use (SU) technologies. The integrated combination of horizontal fermentation and cell culture equipment with SU pressurizable culture bags is expected to drive the adoption of a greater number of flexible, modular, more sustainable production facilities which can be rapidly reproduced around the world. Equivalent performance will be a critical first step toward industry acceptance of this paradigm shift and would demonstrate NHB's novel horizontal fermentor could match or exceed the performance of conventional vertical fermentors. Performance testing was conducted without and with microbes to characterize the SU fermentor design and its microbial growth capabilities.  In order to generate performance data, a 50L pre-production prototype version of NHB?s SU fermentor, capable of running microbial fermentations, was built under an NSF SBIR Phase 1 project (2036270). This project consisted of three phases: (a) design, (b) build, and (c) test; design and build phases were pre-requisites for being able to test. The design phase focused on the three subsystems: (1) the modular stainless steel fermentor/bioreactor vessel (Figure 3) where the bag would be installed and pressurized; (2) the SU fermentor bag (Figure 4&amp;5) in which the microbial fermentation would take place; and (3) the automation (measurement and control) system used for maintaining the fermentation process environment within the fermentor bag where the organisms would be grown. The pre-production prototype design, including electrical schematics, control programs, mechanical drawing and bills of material for each of the subsystems was successfully completed.  With the design phase completed the build phase was implemented, i.e. parts were ordered, and services were contracted. The pre-production 50L system was assembled, instrumented and programmed. Test protocols were written, testing space was obtained, and testing resources were secured.  Upon completion of the manufacturing, the test phase began. Performance testing was conducted without and with microbes to characterize the SU fermentor design and its microbial growth capabilities. Organism-free wet-testing yielded performance data for power density (watts/L), volumetric oxygen mass transfer (kLa) and mixing time (seconds). Power density, mixing times and kLa values for the 50L pre-production were comparable to those obtained on an early stage prototype. A computational fluid dynamics model was developed, and simulations were run to predict shear and velocity distribution data; again, the results were comparable to the early stage prototype. Heat transfer capacity (UA) was determined from flow and temperature measurements on the cooling system during the microbial experiments and was sufficient to maintain culture temperature throughout the growth of the microbes. Two microbial fermentations were run demonstrating the ability to culture microbes to substantial cell densities. NHB, is pleased with the results of the project having demonstrated success for the first time ever controlling pressure up to 5 psig in a SU bag (Figure 6). The design phase yielded a robust design and the establishment of a reliable supply chain to produce the SU fermentor product. Test results demonstrated performance characteristics of this modular, pressurizable, horizontal system that will allow NHB to enter the market with a novel world class scalable system that will offer substantial benefits to the end users regarding productivity output and lower cost facilities. The end goal will be to lower biologic drug costs to the public as new and existing therapies are produced in large quantities. NHB expects to collaborate with a BioPharm producer to further evaluate the system culturing proprietary cell lines specifically targeting a biologic product such as a therapeutic protein or vaccine.
