<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award supports fundamental research exploring the underlying deformation and failure mechanism governing the formation and evolution of extremely buckling driven periodic delaminated patterns with the applied mechanical strain. Buckling instability is ubiquitous in daily lives from human skin wrinkling to blisters on painted walls. It has been pursued as a versatile means to design stretchable devices, as well as dynamically tuning a variety of surface topography related properties in wetting, adhesion, and optics. The knowledge developed through this project could enable and advance multiple surface properties governed technologies, including extremely stretchable electronics, multifunctional smart windows, tunable optics, tunable structural color change for camouflage, water harvesting, self-cleaning, slippery surface, and green surfaces for anti-biofouling.  This work will also provide rich research opportunities for underrepresented groups through the honor program at Temple University and the Women Engineering Exploration program broadening participation for K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through combining a tightly coupled experimental, computational, and theoretical program, this research will explore the mechanics of spontaneously extremely buckling driven periodic delamination of thin film on soft substrates. Experimentally, extremely large pre-stretched strain will be applied to an elastomer substrate, followed by the deposition of metal or semiconductor thin films on it. The pre-strain will be released to generate large-area, periodic extremely delaminated patterns in the form of continuous thin film and discrete ribbons on both microscale and millimeter-scale. The potential cracking failure in the delaminated buckled film and ribbons during the extreme buckling will be examined through experiments and cracking models. To reveal the deformation mechanism, energy-based theoretical modeling, together with cohesive zone modeling based finite element simulation, will be developed to understand and predict the tunable geometry of periodic delaminated buckled profiles with strains. Both the theoretical modeling and numerical simulations will be compared with experiments for validation and modifications.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> Under the support of this grant, Yin and his team have uncovered the mechanics of extreme buckling-driven delamination of thin films on planar soft substrate systems through combined experimental, theoretical, and finite element simulation studies, as well as explored harnessing the uncovered mechanics of buckling instability for multifunctionality in wetting, optics, stretchable electronics, and soft robots. Experimentally, his team have successfully generated periodic buckling-driven delaminated surface patterns on the microscale over a large area in different films on extremely pre-stretched elastomeric substrates (over 100% strain), including gold, copper, and silicon nano-films on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and ecoflex substrates. They have demonstrated the design of crack-free and spontaneous delaminated mciro-ribbons on highly prestrained elastomer substrates. It enabled the achievement of high stretchability of about 120% and 400% in silicon and gold ribbons, respectively. Theoretically, based on the experimental investigation, his team has developed a theoretical framework that governs the formation and evolution of periodic buckle-delamination on both micro- and macro-scale on thin films on extremely pre-stretched elastomers over 400%. They have identified a three-stage deformation regime in the film, from onset of localized blisters in state I, to the growth through delamination crack propagation to form periodic sinusoidal blisters in stage II, and to the transition to post-buckled jig-saw-like blisters under fixed-end compression after crack arrest in stage III. Related energy-based mechanics models on predicting the evolution and geometry of periodic blisters under moderate and large compression are developed and validated through both experiments and finite element simulation.&nbsp;</p> <p>The team also explored harnessing the extreme buckling for multifunctionality. Building upon the developed mechanics model, his team has demonstrated its broad applications in devices and soft robots, including design of stretchable electronics via spontaneous buckle-delamination of gold ribbons with an augmented stretchability of over 200% in gold ribbons, interfacial toughness and fracture strength measurement through the metrology of spontaneously buckle-delaminated and cracking blisters, tunable superphydrophobic wetting, instabilities of smart materials, and harnessing buckling for high-performance soft robots. Overall, 7 journal publications have been published including papers in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, Advanced Materials Interfaces, Advanced Materials Technologies, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, Nature Communications, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and Science Advances. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broad Impacts:</strong> Under the support of the grant, the research results from this grant have enriched the curriculum of two undergraduate and graduate classes in computer aided design and finite element method by integrating them as part of the course lectures and course projects. This grant has fully or partially supported five Ph.D. students and 1 postdoctoral associate with three Ph.D. students who have been graduated. In the summers of 2017 to 2019, Yin<strong> </strong>hosted a half-day Women&rsquo;s Engineering (WE2) summer program for over 300 female students from over 30 nearby high schools in Philadelphia, New Jersey, Virginia, and Delaware, which has provided students with hands-on experiences in wrinkling and buckling-driven delamination of thin films on soft substrates and the applications to stretchable electronics. The research results from this grant has been disseminated through ASME and SES conferences and journal publications, as well as media tools such as LinkedIn, twitter, and Youtube videos and media news report.
