<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[As COVID-19 spreads throughout communities, government officials face a series of challenging decisions, each fraught with an array of difficult tradeoffs. Current efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus by closing non-essential businesses have resulted in the loss of millions of jobs. In addition to the economic costs, lockdown measures have had other unintended consequences that are difficult to measure. Unquestionably, the suffering caused by COVID-19 will go far beyond clinical effects alone. However, if no measures are taken, the virus may spread rapidly, overwhelming local healthcare resources and causing substantial human loss. This raises the urgent question:  How can leaders make public policy decisions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in a scientific way that is locally appropriate and properly accounts for both near-term and longer-term costs of policy interventions? This project combines rigorous mathematical modeling, innovative approaches to data collection, and input from policymakers, to develop a decision aid framework that weighs the costs and benefits of various policy interventions at a local level and tailors interventions to the locale considering the effects of specific indicators such as urbanization, economic distress, and availability of regional healthcare. Additionally, graduate students will be trained in the context of this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop a rigorous understanding of the tradeoffs involved in policy interventions geared at mitigating COVID-19, two complementary approaches will be applied. First, the benefits of policy interventions will be estimated using a new dynamical game-theoretic mathematical COVID-19 epidemic model which accounts for the interactions between social behavior, policy interventions, and disease contagion. Second, the costs of policy interventions will be estimated via geospatial data aggregation and analysis which identifies local vulnerability to unintended consequences of policy interventions and assesses the disparities of these impacts across racial and socioeconomic divides. This project will advance knowledge in two complementary directions. First, the project’s data collection and aggregation activities will create datasets which would be otherwise impossible to recreate if this historic opportunity were missed; these datasets will facilitate our understanding of the connection between the spread of COVID-19 and the emergence of social behavior, identify the long-term costs of infection, and are anticipated to be applicable to future pandemics as well. Second, the project’s game-theoretic epidemiological model captures the feedback interconnection between two dynamical systems (human behavior and disease spread, respectively). These systems and their abstractions have been well-studied in isolation, but their interconnection is not well understood. Mathematical models will be reviewed and revised based on feedback from policymakers in order to best tailor interventions to the locale considering the effects of specific indicators such as urbanization, economic distress, and availability of regional healthcare.  This interdisciplinary project will significantly advance understanding of these inherent societal feedback effects in a data driven, real world context. This RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Our group's results provide the first generalizable means of extending classical results in game-theoretic learning to changing, dynamic environments. In computer science and control theory, this provides new analytical tools to design control algorithms for distributed multiagent systems, such as teamed mobile robots. In computational social science and economics, this informs the study of how behaviors and conventions spread throughout a society.  Furthermore, our models indicate that in a pandemic, individual altruism (i.e., self-directed social distancing) may result in individuals choosing high levels of social isolation, even if the costs are much greater than the potential risk of becoming infected with the disease. This suggests that individual altruism does not suffice to contain the effects of a global pandemic, and makes a strong case for the role of centralized policy measures.  In addition, we applied spatio-temporal analysis to investigate the effects of COVID-19 and lockdown measures on existing public health problems, specifically child abuse and neglect and opioid-related drug overdoses.  We investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of child neglect and abuse in during the pandemic in the city of Los Angeles.  Our analysis identified locations of emerging hot and cold spots during the pandemic. Compared to consecutive cold spots, severe housing burden, the number of assets children have at birth, poverty, school absenteeism, and labor force participation were significantly associated with new and intensifying hotspots of child neglect and abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our findings reinforce the need for developing intervention strategies by targeting resources to specific challenges faced by families during a global pandemic.  Using a similar methodology applied to opioid-related overdose deaths following lockdown measures in the city of Chicago, we found that area-level temporal risk and inequalities in drug overdose mortality increased significantly in the initial months of the pandemic. Furthermore, a change in the area-level deprivation from the first to the fourth quintile increased the relative risk of a drug overdose by 44.5%.  Both studies highlight the importance of contextualizing the spatial and temporal risk to implement effective and safe harm reduction strategies during a global pandemic.  This award has resulted in 5 publications (3 published, 1 accepted, and 1 under review) and 7 conference and workshop presentations, which have disseminated results to a variety of communities, including Public Health, Domestic Violence, Control and Decision Theory, and Criminal Justice.
