<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project supports the 2020 through 2022 offerings of the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program / JSM Diversity Mentoring Program.  These annual programs serve statisticians from underrepresented groups at early- to mid-career levels. Participants are connected to mentors and a network through a four-day experience at the JSM. Additionally, engagement and connections are encouraged beyond the structured experience at the JSM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mentoring relationships are critically important for individuals at all career stages. These relationships result in increased awareness of opportunities, increased insight into organizational culture and politics, and increased access to opportunities or leaders, among other benefits. Establishing such relationships has the ability to impact other objectives of the program as well. Mentors can help motivate students to pursue graduate study or careers in statistics and encourage their proteges to become involved in the American Statistical Association or other professional organizations and can often make connections that increase the access of the workshop participants to these opportunities. The net societal result is a diverse workforce of well-trained, influential leaders in the field of statistics. The website for this project is https://community.amstat.org/cmis/events/dwmp/dmp2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
