<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[We live in a complex social world in which the challenges facing society evolve continuously, and organizations must adapt to meet them. With the rapid growth of social networks over the last two decades and the corresponding availability of big data, the behavioral and social sciences have become increasingly important to the development and growth of organizationsâ€™ capacity to understand and address global challenges. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated the importance of the social sciences in providing guidance during societal crises, particularly with respect to the successful operation of organizations during emergencies. Social, behavioral, and organizational science can help organizations address societal needs, and these contributions can be magnified through collaborations between academia and industry. With respect to such issues as shaping the future of work, harnessing data for societal benefit, supporting diversity and inclusion, advancing team science, establishing successful leadership and mentorship models within organizations, and understanding the impact of artificial intelligence on society, the social sciences are critical for advances and solutions. There are significant opportunities for expanding academic-corporate partnerships in the social sciences to help address urgent societal needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Maryland, College Park, in collaboration with the University Industry Demonstration Partnership, will host a three-day workshop in College Park, Maryland, convening a diverse group of experts and leaders from academia, industry, and government to consider how academic-corporate partnerships can advance social, behavioral, and organizational science research to positively impact science and society. This workshop will help generate more awareness about the collaborative opportunities that exist within the social, behavioral, economic, and organizational science disciplines, and will produce strategies to fuel future industry-university partnerships. The workshop will showcase research collaborations relevant to business practitioners, policy makers, and research communities, examine how organizations develop and operate successfully, especially amid current challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and explore how university-industry collaborations in the social sciences can stimulate discovery, knowledge exchange, and economic development, helping to create value and achieve social impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Collectively, the two events comprised 15 panel sessions, two presentations, and one keynote, and attracted nearly 400 registrants representing industry, academia, government, and nonprofit organizations from across the globe.</p> <p>Over the course of these two events, a diverse group of experts and leaders participated to consider how university-industry partnerships can advance social, behavioral, and organizational science research to positively impact society. The workshop sessions covered a number of timely and relevant topics, including: supporting diversity and inclusion in organizations; shaping the future of work; effective approaches to leadership development; and, understanding the impact of artificial intelligence on society, among many other topics.</p> <p>The event was organized by UMD in partnership with the University  Industry Demonstration  Partnership (UIDP), with support from the  National Science Foundation  (NSF), The MITRE Corporation, Optimal  Solutions, SAGE Publishing, the  Consortium of Social Science  Associations, and the Federation of  Associations in Behavioral &amp;  Brain Sciences.</p> <p>Discussions explored key areas where university-industry social science partnerships could make an impact, including global grand challenges, privacy, behavioral health inequities, climate change, language and linguistics, artificial intelligence, experiential learning, workforce training and development, racially inclusive workplaces, leadership development, and VR police training. Successful partnership models were presented, including an innovative collaboration between Google Jigsaw and the University of Maryland on the creation of a virtual reality application for training and decision making for police officers.</p> <p>Feedback from workshop participants indicated that there was a desire to continue to organize more events that explored opportunities for partnerships in the social sciences. The workshop sessions provided case studies of innovations and enterprises and offered roundtable discussions where attendees could interact directly with each speaker. The workshop sought to exchange ideas and to encourage attendees to bring innovative approaches back to their workplace to help initiate societal improvements, and responses from participants indicated that the workshop was successful in doing so. After the event, one workshop participant said, "I can't wait to take  what I learned about social entrepreneurship back to share with  administrators and faculty at my university."</p> <p>Additional feedback from participants included the following excerpts:</p> <p>"I really enjoyed this opportunity to learn from others doing interesting and important work in this space.?</p> <p>"The event allowed me to meet with people of like minds and took me a step closer to my goal of creating a better environment for the underserved populations.

It would be highly interesting to continue this conversation.?</p> <p>?It was a pleasure to be in the space with so many other like-minded professionals looking to advance the work being done within the social sciences.?</p> <p>?The workshop provided a good overview on how the social sciences can engage with industry.?</p> <p>?The presentations were very informative and diverse in their points of focus, far beyond my expectations. I expected information about innovative ways to conduct and share research, which was given (e.g., preprint process was very helpful to learn). I was pleasantly surprised by the presentations on creative ways universities can engage various industries, such as the experiential learning models shared. It was beneficial to hear about successful experiential models from the university perspective and from the industry perspective.
