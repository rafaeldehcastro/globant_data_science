<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The speed at which the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed suggests that there may be more infection pathways than presently understood. Infection through the inhalation of virus carrying aerosols is one possible path. However, evidence is still lacking to fully understand the infection risks posed by aerosol inhalation. Collecting air samples for the analysis of SARS-CoV2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 disease) will help determine whether and how aerosols play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Such knowledge will allow health care professionals and other policy makers to implement practices to protect the public health. The need for this information is urgent, as a second wave of COVID-19 is projected for Fall 2020 with potentially more serious impacts due to overlap with seasonal flu. The goal of this project is to develop specific and rapid on-the-spot air sampling and detection technology to address a need for aerosol monitoring. The project team includes scholars with complimentary expertise in air sampling, device design, and virology. Successful completion of this research will provide critical knowledge that can serve as an early warning system of the presence of SARS-CoV2 and help the transition back to regular economic and social activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COVID-19 has impacted human health on a global scale. Information on the transmission mode of SARS-CoV2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19 disease) is urgently needed to protect the public and prevent further spread of the disease. The goal of this project is to identify the role of aerosols in the spread of SARS-CoV2 and involves the development of a rapid aerosol monitor based on an existing module successfully developed for Zika virus. The research team is composed of an aerosol scientist, a mechanical engineer, and a virologist, who have the complimentary expertise and needed facilities to rapidly achieve the goal. Project researchers will (1) conduct air sampling at healthcare facilities that have cared for COVID-19 patients to assess if SARS-CoV2 virus is transmissible via aerosols; (2) develop an on-the-spot virus nucleic acid detection module for analysis of SARS-CoV2 virus.  The module will be validated by comparison with analytical results from CDC-approved tests; and (3) deploy the air sampler detection module in public venues for early detection of a possible second wave of COVID-19. This timely study will provide significant information about the role of aerosol transmission of the SARS-CoV2 virus and offer a powerful tool to rapidly detect the virus in air. If aerosol transmission is proven to be a significant exposure pathway in healthcare facilities, operations may be swiftly revised to better protect healthcare workers fighting the pandemic. Early detection of outbreaks and a potential secondary wave of COVID-19 will enable proactive measures to protect public health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Such knowledge is important in developing effective infection control strategies to better protect the public from the COVID-19 pandemic.  To address this key knowledge gap of how the virus spreads, we conducted environmental surveillance in different indoor settings using a novel virus aerosol sampler and developed a portable device to enable on-the-spot detection of SARS-CoV-2.    Adopting the same process that occurs when airborne particles are inhaled into human lungs on a cold day, our novel system effectively enlarges the size of particles through water vapor condensation that enables efficient collection of these virus-laden particles from air.

Our work was the first to show: (a) strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could remain viable in small particles in aerosols, thus posing an inhalation risk, and (b) that airborne transmission is a likely route of COVID-19 transmission.  We further demonstrated virus-laden aerosol particles were detected in the range &lt;0.25 &mu;m to &gt;4.4 &mu;m, which includes the respirable particle size range (&lt; 5 &mu;m).  These particles can remain suspended in air for a long time and travel over long distances. This finding further supports the importance of aerosol transmission for SARS-CoV-2.  Results from this project have changed our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from person to person; previously, the main route of transmission was thought to be by large droplets and fomites.  Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Diseases Control (CDC) previously advised the public that droplet transmission between people in close proximity was the main route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, completely ignoring the role of aerosol transmission.  Our finding offered information that likely influenced the decision makers of the WHO and CDC to consider aerosol transmission. Ultimately, they changed their guidance regarding how the public should better protect themselves against SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with attention paid to the risks posed by virus in aerosols.  Another important impact of our work was related to reopening.  As the lockdown restrictions were lifted and the reopening of public spaces occurred gradually such as college campuses, fitness centers, and restaurants, people had strong desire to resume normal living conditions but were still concerned about potential infection resulting from exposure.  Our environmental surveillance provided evidence how following CDC reopening guidance (e.g., enhanced ventilation, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, face covering, disinfection, physical distancing, and reduced capacity) could lower risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections.   The gold-standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in samples, such as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), takes hours to complete, and its execution is often delayed for days due to sample transportation, storage, preparation and analysis.  This barrier impedes the making of a swift administrative decision how to best control the virus? spread.  To overcome the barrier, we built a portable device for on-the-spot detection through sequential delivery of reagents within the device.  Using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), we attained a limit of detection of 10 genomic equivalents, which is comparable with the standard benchtop RT-PCR method. Importantly, the assay was completed within 25 min, which is significantly less than the 2-hr duration needed by standard RT-PCR assays.  On-the-spot detection of SARS-CoV-2 by our portable device would lead to fast determination of the presence of the target virus at the point of care, allowing decision makers to determine the appropriate mitigation measures to best protect the public in the surveilled location.  Our sampling and on-the-spot detection system will be a useful tool for the early-detection of airborne viruses in the community, and the information it generated will assist policy makers to develop control strategies for minimizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  Once the novel platform is widely deployed, the future for virus-laden aerosol monitoring can be significantly improved by added efficacy, efficiency, and accuracy, and this will help our society better prepare for next viral pandemic.  In addition, the cohesive collaboration among multidisciplinary members has led to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers trained with knowledge and skills in diverse fields.  Involvement of undergraduate researchers has motivated and better prepared them for pursuit of advanced education.          Last Modified: 07/23/2021       Submitted by: Chang-Yu Wu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
