<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Primates depend heavily on plants resources for food in subtropical and tropical forests. However, the way in which overall forest structure and function is related to primate ecology and behavior is not fully understood. Tree species differ in their traits, some of which affect plant growth and survival (e.g., leaf mass), while others (e.g., fruit sugars) negative or positively affect primates. A "trait landscape" results from tree species' spatial distributions and traits, including phenological activity (e.g., flowering). This doctoral dissertation project examines how the constellation of plant traits in forests that primates inhabit affect primate diet, nutrition, and mating patterns such as monogamy. This project contributes to professional development and STEM education of undergraduates and assistants from local communities. International collaborators, including students and assistants, will obtain hands-on training in canopy access techniques, drone remote sensing, and programming using Python. The project will also support K-12 curriculum development and primate conservation in the study region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to identify important ecological correlates of primate diet and monogamous mating system, by carefully considering and incorporating the bottom-up roles of plant traits and the spatiotemporal details of forest ecology and composition. Specifically, the project will examine the bottom-up effects of a tree community’s spatiotemporal distribution of functional and trophic effect traits on the nutritional ecology and mating pattern of Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarae azarae). The researchers will (1) consider the owl monkeys' diet and nutritional ecology in a forest ecology context by considering the functional ecology/trait space of the tree community, and juxtapose their findings with those of traditional nutritional ecology analyses, and (2) assess how and why functional and trophic effect traits are equally distributed over space and time in gallery forests, with pair-living and a monogamous mating system as corollaries. The researchers will collect standardized plant samples and analyze these for functional traits, nutrients, and plant secondary compounds. They will furthermore assess the spatiotemporal details of species distribution and phenology through drone remote sensing, and statistically analyze spatial, nutritional, and community ecology parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

For this project, the co-PI, Griette van der Heide, spent a total of 17 months at the Owl Monkey Project in Formosa Province, Argentina. Field work was completed at the end of June 2021, after intermittent and sparse access to the field site due to the global coronavirus outbreak. During this period the co-PI and her local team collected tree functional trait data (e.g., crown volume, fruit weight) from 67 species, of which more than 50% were sampled multiple times. She furthermore georeferenced sampled trees and transect points to align on the ground tree species observations with remotely sensed imagery for tree classification purposes.</p> <p>While in Formosa, the co-PI fully trained three research assistants/students from la Universidad Nacional de Formosa (UNaF) and partially trained four other assistants from Argentina, and one from Canada, in tree climbing techniques. Several practice climbs were done on public land (riverine forest, UNaF terrain) or in neighborhood backyards, providing opportunity to give impromptu<em> </em>canopy access demonstrations, dissemination of research objectives, and general information regarding owl monkeys to local Formosenos/Chacoans. Three assistants continue to work on primate research and/or canopy access outreach.</p> <p>Assistants were furthermore trained in primate observations, tree identification, field equipment use (e.g., telemetry, compass, binoculars, GPS, camera traps, clinometer), as well as phenology, whole tree, fruit, and leaf functional trait measurements. Four assistants were trained in basic drone operations (sensor/drone system set-up, drone/flight tracking). Though formal workshops were impossible in Formosa during the pandemic, informal one-on-one trainings were done on general data management, the use of reference managers, as well as Python scripts&nbsp;&minus; specifically to clean and report phenology data.</p> <p>The co-PI's activities in Formosa have also led to collaborations with various UNaF professors; botanists regarding tree identification and newly registered plant species in Formosa, Dr. Juarez (primatologist) regarding a long-term seed bank/species conservation project, as well as forestry professors regarding general Chaco (canopy) ecology. The co-PI's professional relations at UNaF and her social network resulting from her Formosa-based research team strengthened her connection with people from the Gran Chaco, and her knowledge of the Gran Chaco ecosystem.</p> <p>Despite setbacks caused by the pandemic, precluding the execution of certain field and lab components, we were able to preserve the scope and topic of this project by collaborating with various entities from which we obtained data as partial replacements for on-site data ('Planet' for satellite imagery, 'TRY' for species trait data). To deepen discussion, the co-PI has established a database (&gt;1000 records) on feeding information, including plant species and parts consumed, from all studied <em>Aotus </em>spp. across the Neotropics to which our results can be compared. She is furthermore broadening her dissertation by writing a reflective chapter on what the pandemic meant for research and forests in the Argentinean Gran Chaco. While the co-PI is still analyzing data and writing scientific articles, she has nearly finished a modelling approach to identify tree species&nbsp;&minus; based on traits like basal area and fruit crop&nbsp;&minus; as likely candidates of 'monogamy resources' under the resource defense hypothesis of monogamy. This included extended Python modelling of several rarity and dispersion indices, as well as a comprehensive measure of 'resource reliability.' The resulting Python code serves to <em>a priori</em> predict which tree species may help maintain primate monogamy but can more broadly be applied for primate conservation purposes at any site with vegetation data.</p> <p>We furthermore disseminated our general research ideas and focus to the global tree climbing community at a joint event by the Global Organization of Tree Climbers (GOTC) and the Big Canopy Campout (BCC). Both organizations are non-profits with a shared goal to bring attention to the world's canopies.

She is slated to lead a workshop on 'sampling the canopy for researchers' at an in-person GOTC meeting in 2022, which is attracting many young canopy scientists from Asia and Central- and South America. We will continue to disseminate our research to the wider public through a bilingual GOTC blog post, a news item in CU Boulder Today, a presentation at a CU's undergraduate 'Anthro Club' meeting and climbs with Colorado Girl Scouts.
