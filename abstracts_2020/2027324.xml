<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is a promising technology that was proposed to eliminate the costly data transmission between memory and computing units in conventional computer architectures. An input data can be directly injected into the memory that stores a constant for a computation without loading the constant to the computing unit. Such a design is particularly suitable for many emerging computations, such as graph analytics and neuromorphic computing, where one of the operands is constant during the computation while only the input changes. By eliminating the data transmission between the memory and computing units, PIM can substantially improve the computational efficiency of these applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project organizes a workshop to gather leading researchers and experts who have spent considerable effort and time studying Processing-In-Memory (PIM) technology. The proposed workshop will provide a forum for leading experts to consider in a synergistic manner a view of PIM technology from the perspective of circuits, architectures, systems, and applications.  These researchers will discuss their visions of the critical challenges that need to be addressed in the near future. With the help of the participants, the workshop will produce a comprehensive report on the current state of the art and the outlook of PIM technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Due to COVID-19, the original on-campus workshop (at GMU) was changed to an online workshop  in March 2021. The overall workshop had two components: (1) Online Pilot Talks and (2) Online Workshop. 6 pilot talks were organized online and public to registered attendees. The online workshop invited experts in this area for keynote presentations and each research thrust had its dedicated panel discussion. More than 100 researchers participated in the 1.5-day workshop. All the participants agree that PIM is a promising research direction with great potential in AI and other emerging applications. The identified challenges and technology roadmap offer valuable guidance to future relevant research.          Last Modified: 08/03/2021       Submitted by: Yiran Chen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
