<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential to digitize access to high-quality custom prosthetic and orthotic devices. This will increase convenience and reduce the cost of care for millions of people with limb loss or other disabilities. In 2018, the leading cause of amputations was complications from diabetes and peripheral vascular diseases, and 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed among U.S. adults aged 18 years or older. Despite progress in other aspects of prosthetic limb design, inefficiencies in the design and manufacture of the custom prosthetic socket still exist. The proposed technology uses a computational approach to digitize the biomechanical design required to develop high-quality, custom prosthetic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project goal is to digitize and automate customization of wearable devices that conform to the portion of a person’s limb remaining after an amputation. The function of this device (i.e. prosthetic socket) is to re-distribute pressure to areas of the person’s soft tissues that tolerate those pressures. This project will introduce new guidelines and processes for prosthetic socket design. The objectives include: (1) codify, modify, and implement existing design guidelines within a biomechanics engine to manage customizations for the individual user; and (2) implement a machine learning framework using training datasets of paired limbs and prosthetic sockets. The techniques developed by this work can be extended to other biomechanical processes with load/pressure transfer considerations beyond prosthetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last two decades there have been significant technological advances in digital tools like 3-Dimensional scanners, computer aided design software, and computer aided manufacturing techniques. However, efficient adoption of these digital tools in the Prosthetics and Orthotics industry continue to lag adoption in comparable industries like Orthodontics.  We interviewed &gt;100 active prosthetic limb providers and stakeholders to understand the adoption barriers. The top reasons reported were:  (1) Existing digital tools are low resolution and not appropriate for complex clinical use-cases,  (2) Tools are often difficult to use, requiring extensive technical and software design training that is not part of the practitioner curriculum.   Using the NSF-SBIR Phase I award, we have developed and validated a computational framework to automatically characterize the biomechanical design of existing custom prosthetic sockets. The framework enables us directly to codify the socket design of skilled clinical providers and validate the quality of these designs using relevant clinical outcome measures from patients. This work represents a critical piece to the development of quantified and validated guidelines for prosthetic socket design that can be contributed to the industry's intellectual body of knowledge.  Additionally, it forms the technology basis for development of high-resolution, digital workflows for the potentially automated design of consistently high-quality, custom prosthetic sockets.  Our technology unlocks a sustainable business model to lower the access cost of high-quality assistive devices for people with limb loss in rural and difficult to reach parts of the world. There is a useful societal value in providing access to custom, high-quality, and affordable prosthetic care for people with an unmet need who would otherwise not have services.
