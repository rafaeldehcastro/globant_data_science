<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 55-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum.  The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support to foster global transdisciplinary research teams of natural (including climate), health and social scientists and stakeholders from across the globe to improve understanding of climate, environment and health pathways to protect and promote health. The projects will provide crucial new understanding into the health implications arising from the impacts of climate change and variability on; 1) the quality/quantity of food, 2) chronic exposure to increases/changes in heat and humidity and 3) changes in the distribution and incidence of a range of infectious diseases and emergence of novel pathogens. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries to increase our knowledge of the complex linkages and pathways between the climate, environment and health to help solve complex challenges that face societies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to understand and quantify how extreme heat impacts human health.  Heat stress caused from exposure to extreme heat and aridity are strongly associated with adverse health issues.  Pregnant women have unique vulnerabilities, particularly in low- and lower-middle income countries, where pregnancy is often precarious, even in the absence of heat stress.  Long-term impacts of heat stress in pregnancy extend into adulthood, affecting health and economic prospects.  Maternal and neonatal health is a critical area of health service delivery and there is a substantial need for evidence translation and risk assessment in the current global health strategies.  The project will focus on sub-Saharan Africa where substantial warming and increased aridity is occurring and expected to continue.  It will assess the efficacy of various low-cost interventions to reduce heat burden and provide critical knowledge to national adaptation plans and climate services programs in Africa which rarely prioritize health risks of extreme heat.  The project will quantify impacts of heat exposure by linking weather and climate data sets, and projections with data from birth cohorts, clinical trials, birth registries and demographic study sites.  The results will benefit a broad range of local and national-level stakeholders, including local communities, government, health service agencies, and local and national decision-makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
