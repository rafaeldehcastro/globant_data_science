<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the uses of a new platform useful for studying cell cultures with different oxygen levels. Oxygen, an important factor for cell life and development, is typically not controlled in conventional culture conditions, but for specific studies low oxygen levels must be maintained.  For instance, low oxygen levels help researchers study diseases, human tissues and even biological processes. Other processes, such as disorders of the digestive system, some infectious diseases, and the human microbiome, are studied with no oxygen. Current technologies for performing these cell culture techniques are either inadequate, burdensome or too expensive for widespread use. The proposed technology is a compact and affordable oxygen-controlling platform for cell cultures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of an oxygen-controlling cryogel cell culture platform. Cryogels are an advanced type of hydrogels with a unique set of physical properties, including an interconnected and microporous 3D network, shape memory features, and are syringe injectable. Low oxygen tension (i.e., hypoxia) is associated with some tissues and diseases, and anaerobic cell culture is essential for studying gastrointestinal disorders, infectious diseases and the human microbiome. The proposed technology is a compact and affordable oxygen-controlling cryogel platform that creates oxygen-controlled conditions directly within the cellular environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cell culture is one of the most widely used techniques in biomedical research, in which scientists attempt to grow cells in conditions like those found in the body. However, one key parameter is not controlled: oxygen. In fact, most cell culture experiments are conducted in ambient air, where the oxygen concentration is up to 50-fold higher than it is in the body. Culturing cells at irrelevant high oxygen levels induces deleterious effects on cell health. During the NSF I-Corps Teams Program, the Cryoxia Biosciences cohort conducted 104 interviews with biomedical subject matter experts and discovered that the reason oxygen is not controlled in cell culture is because commercial oxygen-controlling equipment has several significant limitations. These include: (<em>i</em>) the equipment is too expensive and requires high start-up costs, (<em>ii</em>) is a hassle to set-up, maintain and use, (<em>iii</em>) takes up too much laboratory space, (<em>iv</em>) limits scientists to one oxygen concentration per experiment, and (<em>v</em>) most importantly poorly controls oxygen concentration. These problems are faced by biomedical scientists performing hypoxic (low oxygen: &lt;3% O<sub>2</sub>) and physiologic (3-14% O<sub>2</sub>) cell culture in research universities, institutions, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. During our interviews, we also evaluated if Cryoxia Biosciences&rsquo; oxygen-controlling cryogels, tablets that control oxygen in cell culture, had product-market fit for oxygen-controlled cell culture. We learned that cell culture users were not interested in adding these tablets to their cultures due to hassle and potential interactions with cells. We hypothesized that integrating the core oxygen-controlling technology directly into the cell culture vessels would address these problems. Indeed, our new product concept the Oxygen-controlling Cell Culture (OCC) System, achieved product-market fit for biomedical researchers performing hypoxic and physiologic cell culture. The true impact of culturing cells in non-physiological conditions on basic research, drug screening, and cell-based therapies will not be fully understood until oxygen-controlled cell culture becomes a paradigm in the biomedical field.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/11/2022<br>      Modified by: Sidi&nbsp;A&nbsp;Bencherif</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
