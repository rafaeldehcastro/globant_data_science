<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on new displays and AR/VR device applications based on nanowire microLEDs (μLEDs). Financial and environmental benefits include lower electricity costs and reduced emissions from decreased consumption. LEDs in micron- or sub-micron size with high efficiency and low power consuming are desirable for applications such as micro-displays for cell phones and wearable electronics. The high efficiency, high color-rendering properties, and low power consumption μLEDs are perfectly suitable as an alternative replacement of current display technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores translation of μLEDs for display and AR/VR device applications. Among different approaches of generating RGB and white color μLEDs for LED displays, the monolithic display based on III-nitride nanowire heterostructure μLEDs is promising since it allows more direct control of emission wavelengths of the LEDs. Our solution, full-color and white-color nanowire μLEDs, offer several improvements over current LED technologies. The color emissions of our μLEDs can be readily varied from blue to red with highly stable light emission. Compared to conventional planar structures, our nanowire μLEDs exhibit several distinct advantages, including reduced strain-induced polarization fields and dislocation densities. The nanowire μLEDs can be more efficient in heat dissipation due to reduced current spreading resistance, and resulting in increased injection current levels. Improved efficiency and thermal management allow the integration of μLEDs onto flexible substrates, typically less thermally and electrically conductive. These nanowire μLEDs are expected to perform better than their thin-film counterparts for micro-display applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
