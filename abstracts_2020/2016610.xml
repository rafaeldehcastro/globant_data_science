<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Scientific workflows are used almost universally across research and engineering disciplines and have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades (e.g., first detection of gravitational waves from colliding black holes, the discovery of the Higgs boson, and the detection of an exotic nuclear decay). Workflow management systems (WMSs) are software systems that provide abstraction and automation for facilitating access to and management of distributed and heterogeneous compute and storage resources. They enable a broad range of researchers to easily define sophisticated computational processes and to then execute them efficiently on parallel and distributed computing platforms. Unfortunately, in spite of widespread adoption of workflows,  the technology landscape is segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the existence of dozens of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems. The research landscape is also disjoint, making it difficult to compare and contrast approaches, verify and reproduce results, and build upon existing work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will engage with representatives from the workflows community â€“ including researchers, developers, science and engineering users, and cyberinfrastructure experts. Through targeted community surveys and focused workshops, the project will gather a diverse set of perspectives, create a community-owned WMS inventory and common knowledge taxonomy, define an experimental methodology for measuring WMS capabilities, and develop a blueprint for a community research infrastructure. This proposed infrastructure has the potential to truly democratize workflows research, enabling researchers, postdocs, and students, irrespective of their institutions, to access cutting-edge infrastructure for comparison, evaluation, and verification of workflows research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The summit included 48 invited participants from a select group of international (Austria, Brazil, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA) lead researchers from distinct workflow management systems and users, and representatives from the National Science Foundation (NSF), and Department of Energy (DoE). The overarching goal of the summit was to develop a view of the state of the art and identify crucial research challenges in the workflow community. The summit focused on six themes: (i) FAIR computational workflows, (ii) Training and education for workflow users, (iii) AI workflows, (iv) Exascale challenges and beyond, (v) APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards, and (vi) Building a workflows community. The end goal was to identify other challenges, if need be, and outline short- and long-term community efforts that could help tackle these challenges.</span> </li> </ul> <p><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span></p> <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;"> <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Workflows Community Summit: Advancing the State-of-the-art of Scientific Workflows Management Systems Research and Development </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">(</span><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915801"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915801</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">):</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The second "Workflows Community Summit" took place on April 7, 2021. The summit included 75 participants from a group of international researchers and developers (Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, UK, and USA)&nbsp; from distinct workflow management systems and users, and representatives from the NSF and DoE. While the first summit focused on establishing a high level vision, this second summit explored technical approaches for realizing (part of) that vision. Consequently, we strived to engage participants who are actively involved in workflow system development. Based on the outcomes of the first summit, we identified three technical topics for discussion: (i) Definition of common workflow patterns and benchmarks (both for determining workflow system functionality and for providing users with tutorial examples); (ii) Identifying paths toward interoperability of workflow systems; and (iii) Improving workflow systems' interface with legacy and emerging HPC software and hardware stacks.</span> </li> </ul> <p><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span></p> <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;"> <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Workflows Community Summit: Tightening the Integration between Computing Facilities and Scientific Workflows </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">(</span><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5815332"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5815332</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">): The third "Workflows Community Summit" took place on November 8, 2021. The summit included 14 participants from various computing centers and facilities. Based on the outcomes of the first two summits, we identified the need to share outcomes with computing centers and facilities, as well as to capture their perspectives regarding workflow systems and applications. To this end, this third summit was organized as a focused session with a small group of participants with the aim to understand how workflows are currently being used at each facility, how facilities would like to interact with workflow developers and users, how workflows fit with facility roadmaps, and what opportunities there are for tighter integration between facilities and workflows.</span> </li> </ul> <p><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;

The outcomes of the three Workflows Community Summits have been compiled and published in three technical reports and one research paper:    Workflows Community Summit: Bringing the Scientific Workflows Research Community Together (http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4606958): The first "Workflows Community Summit" was held online on January 13, 2021. The summit included 48 invited participants from a select group of international (Austria, Brazil, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA) lead researchers from distinct workflow management systems and users, and representatives from the National Science Foundation (NSF), and Department of Energy (DoE). The overarching goal of the summit was to develop a view of the state of the art and identify crucial research challenges in the workflow community. The summit focused on six themes: (i) FAIR computational workflows, (ii) Training and education for workflow users, (iii) AI workflows, (iv) Exascale challenges and beyond, (v) APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards, and (vi) Building a workflows community. The end goal was to identify other challenges, if need be, and outline short- and long-term community efforts that could help tackle these challenges.        Workflows Community Summit: Advancing the State-of-the-art of Scientific Workflows Management Systems Research and Development (http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4915801): The second "Workflows Community Summit" took place on April 7, 2021. The summit included 75 participants from a group of international researchers and developers (Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, UK, and USA)  from distinct workflow management systems and users, and representatives from the NSF and DoE. While the first summit focused on establishing a high level vision, this second summit explored technical approaches for realizing (part of) that vision. Consequently, we strived to engage participants who are actively involved in workflow system development. Based on the outcomes of the first summit, we identified three technical topics for discussion: (i) Definition of common workflow patterns and benchmarks (both for determining workflow system functionality and for providing users with tutorial examples); (ii) Identifying paths toward interoperability of workflow systems; and (iii) Improving workflow systems' interface with legacy and emerging HPC software and hardware stacks.        Workflows Community Summit: Tightening the Integration between Computing Facilities and Scientific Workflows (http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5815332): The third "Workflows Community Summit" took place on November 8, 2021. The summit included 14 participants from various computing centers and facilities. Based on the outcomes of the first two summits, we identified the need to share outcomes with computing centers and facilities, as well as to capture their perspectives regarding workflow systems and applications. To this end, this third summit was organized as a focused session with a small group of participants with the aim to understand how workflows are currently being used at each facility, how facilities would like to interact with workflow developers and users, how workflows fit with facility roadmaps, and what opportunities there are for tighter integration between facilities and workflows.        Research Paper: A Community Roadmap for Scientific Workflows Research and Development, 2021 DOI:  https://doi.org/10.1109/WORKS54523.2021.00016.   As an outcome of this planning project, we have established a Workflows Community Initiative (https://workflows.community) to bring the workflows community together (users, developers, researchers, and facilities) and provide community resources and capabilities to enable scientists and workflow systems developers to discover software products, related efforts, events, technical reports, etc. and engage in community-wide efforts to tackle workflows grand challenges.
