<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[For nearly four decades, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has played a leadership role in provisioning advanced cyberinfrastructure capabilities for the Nation's Science and Engineering (S&amp;E) researchers. An important component in this investment is the leadership-class computing program that provides computational and data analytics capabilities at the largest scale to inspire transformative S&amp;E discoveries that would not be possible otherwise. NSF's current leadership-class computing investment supports Frontera, the largest High-Performance Computing (HPC) system on a US academic campus. The Frontera system is deployed and operated by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin. This travel grant will support the participation of researchers who have been awarded a computer time allocation on the Frontera system at a future Principal Investigator (PI) meeting organized by TACC. The award will also support travel for technical coordination between researchers and the Frontera project to ensure optimal and effective utilization of the Frontera system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the PI meeting is to allow Frontera research users, as well as their students, to share scientific results, exchange practical lessons-learned, and present their overall experience from using the Frontera system. In addition to research presentations, the meeting will have ample time, as well as facilitated sessions, to promote increased interaction between Frontera research users and project staff. The outcome of the PI meeting will not only enable the Frontera project to better understand and serve the scientific research community, but also build a community to better represent the unique needs of S&amp;E research that require access to NSF leadership computing facilities. To facilitate deeper coordination beyond the PI meeting, this award will also provide travel support to enable technical coordination between the research user teams and the Frontera project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this small supplemental grant was to support an ongoing computational project on the Frontera supercomputer by allowing the PI to travel to Frontera user meetings. Unfortunately, due to the COVID pandemic no travel was possible during the duration of the award and, consequently, no money was spent.  However, the computational project itself is proceeding successfully and is described below for convenience.  This project is broadly aimed at understanding several physical processes affecting the boundary between the heliosphere (the local "bubble" surrounding the Sun and immersed in the interstellar medium) in the and the local interstellar medium. A large fraction of the effort is dedicated to understanding of the influence of a special population of particles, called non-thermal pickup ions (PUIs), which are formed by interaction (charge exchange) of neutral particles originating in the interstellar medium with fast-flowing charged particles of solar origin (the solar wind). Pickup ions become increasingly more important within the heliosphere at larger distances away from the Sun.  More specifically, the computational project aims to:  1. Conduct large-scale fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to investigate how thermal and non-thermal protons are energized at the heliospheric termination shock and in the local interstellar medium behind the heliopause (the heliosphere boundary). PIC simulations provide the most complete description of the physics that is thought to be important for these processes, but are challenging and can only cover relatively small extent of spatial scales in the immediate vicinity of the shock transition.

Perform global simulations of the solar wind flow and its interaction with the local interstellar medium, where pick up ions will be treated as a separate fluid. These simulations will use the results of the previous objective as the boundary conditions for pickup ions crossing the termination shock.     The project is a collaborative effort between the Space Science Institute and the University of the Alabama, Huntsville. Of the topics listed above, the Space Science Institute group is responsible for the kinetic shock simulations.
