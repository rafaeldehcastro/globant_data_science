<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[In recent months, the global COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a surge in pandemic-related false information, exposing shortcomings in the diffusion of high quality information through online networks and in our understanding of who is most susceptible to false and misleading information during times of crisis. Important questions remain about who is able to discriminate low-quality information from high-quality information related to COVID-19 and who is most vulnerable to low-quality information during the pandemic. This project investigates susceptibility to false and misleading information both in the time of, and related to, the COVID-19 pandemic. As government agencies, civic organizations, and for-profit companies work together to combat coronavirus-related false information, an understanding of who is most likely to believe false information — and mistrust true information — is necessary for crafting and distributing targeted public health communications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social and behavioral literature offer competing insights into how the current epidemic might impact people’s ability to evaluate the veracity of information. This project will test a series of theoretically informed hypotheses about why we might expect people’s ability to correctly identify the veracity of information to change in the time of COVID-19, and why we might expect people’s ability to discern the veracity of COVID-19 related information to differ from their ability to ascertain the veracity of non-Covid-19 related information. By sourcing real time news articles to crowds of ordinary citizens as well as professional fact checkers over a multi-month period, this project will investigate the individual-level determinants of susceptibility to false information in real time, whether ordinary citizens can be employed to crowdsource the labeling of high- and low-quality information, and whether crowdsourced fact-checking can reduce the prevalence of false information in the information ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project examined susceptibility to false and misleading news about the Covid-19 pandemic in the first month(s) and year of the pandemic; it also assessed people’s ability to identify the veracity of news generally as a baseline for comparison. Previous research offers competing insights into how the pandemic might impact vulnerability to misinformation, and we sought to test theoretically-motivated hypotheses about people’s ability to identify the veracity of news during this period.

For Study 2, which ran once a week from July 2020 through January 2021, we sourced 10 articles per week (a total of 420 articles assessed by 90 respondents each). In both studies, the 10 articles were split between five "normal" news articles (using the article selection mechanism from our previous study) and five Covid-19-related articles (using a dictionary-based method to determine that the article covered the pandemic). Each article was also assessed by a panel of six fact-checkers, the evaluations of which were used to determine an article’s veracity.

Second, ideological congruence (i.e. the alignment of the ideology of a respondent and of a news article) and familiarity with the false story were most strongly associated with belief in false news, both for Covid-19 related and general false news stories.

Future analyses of data from this project will explore who believes and disbelieves true news around COVID, the impact of local case counts on belief in false news, and the relationship between belief in false news and self-reported health behaviors.    As government agencies, civic organizations, and for-profit companies work together to combat coronavirus-related misinformation, an understanding of who is most likely to believe false news (and mistrust true news) is necessary for crafting and distributing targeted public health communications.
