<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a manufacturing method for a new class of environmentally friendly, sustainable biopesticides. Chemical pesticides pollute the environment and cause harm to humans and other nontarget organisms. In contrast, biopesticides are safe to humans and the environment. The proposed project is a platform to manufacture special chemicals to enhance food security and sustainable agricultural practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed SBIR Phase I project addresses the feasibility of manufacturing nematode dispersal pheromones using in vitro fermentation to control agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic nematodes are natural bioinsecticides commercially produced using in vitro fermentation; they produce pheromones that can greatly enhance their efficacy as biocontrol agents. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing nematode dispersal pheromones using in vitro fermentation methods with the following technical tasks: 1) An in vitro fermentation system will be established using Steinernema feltiae in shaker flasks; 2) Optimum harvesting time for dispersal pheromones will be determined using dispersal assays; 3) The effectiveness of the produced pheromones will be compared with that of in vivo counterparts for dispersal and infectivity; 4) Media will be supplemented to boost pheromone production and create a platform for specific pheromone mixtures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
