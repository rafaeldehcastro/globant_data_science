<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Connecticut Summer School in Number Theory (CTNT 2020) is a summer school in number theory for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, to be followed by a research conference, taking place at at the University of Connecticut, Storrs campus, from June 8 through June 14, 2020. The summer school will achieve several outcomes: expose undergraduate and beginning graduate students to accessible topics that are fundamental to contemporary number theory; provide an environment where students interested in number theory can meet each other and network with students, postdocs, and faculty from institutions where number theory is a strong research area; train women and underrepresented minorities on topics of current importance in number theory; allow advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students to attend a research conference in number theory; videotape the lectures and post them online at a dedicated website to reach as wide of an audience as possible later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CTNT 2020 will consist of a 4.5-day summer school followed by a 2-day conference. The summer school will have six mini-courses on topics important to contemporary number theory that are not available in a typical college curriculum, such as local fields, infinite Galois theory, curves over finite fields, and computational number theory.  The courses will be complemented with course projects, daily invited talks, evening problem sessions, and discussion panels about aspects of graduate school (both for those already in graduate school and those thinking of applying). The conference will consist of several sessions with research talks in number theory, arithmetic geometry, and related topics, and it will be an opportunity for young researchers to present their work. The conference website is https://ctnt-summer.math.uconn.edu/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
