<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[BRIGHT-CS PD (Building Student Retention through Individuated Guided coHort Training in Computer Science Professional Development) a CS for All High School strand Researcher-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) submitted by the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). BRIGHT-CS PD will provide math and science teachers access to and support for rigorous CS learning. The RPP will collaboratively create robust professional development (PD) materials for high school teachers to improve school and classroom practices to better support and broaden participation of black girls in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on the BRIGHT-CS middle school student and school projects. Lessons learned from these projects indicate that robust PD materials for teachers are critical to systemically broadening the participation of black girls in CS. The proposed RPP will work with math and science teachers to provide access and support as the teachers participate in high-quality, extant CS instruction via Harvard Universityâ€™s CS50 courseware. The RPP team will then work with these teachers to adapt and build out their new, up-to-date CS/CT knowledge via robust PD materials designed to help teachers inculcate CS/CT skills into their math and science instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Cohort 1 included 15 educators in two school districts in Virginia, serving over 19,000 students. Cohort 2 expanded to 27 educators in eight school districts in Maryland and Virginia, serving over 36,000 students. The RPP members included core content area teachers (i.e., math, science, English, reading); district and school leaders; and specialized educators (e.g., special education, English learner services, school psychologists, speech/ OT therapists; counselors; librarians; reading specialists) who have a strong commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and school improvement.</p> <p>The RPP created learning conditions for the team and PD materials to support educators. These materials focused on: 1) <strong><em>Instructional improvements:</em></strong> The RPP educators engaged in rigorous CS/CT learning using materials adapted from Harvard University&rsquo;s CS50, core research on best practices in learning from the CS and equity research fields, and team expertise and mentoring from the RPP team. The RPP produced PD materials framed by CS/CT and design thinking as a strategy to produce more equitable instructional practices. 2) <strong><em>Structural improvements:</em></strong><em> </em>The RPP educators worked on debugging and redesigning structures for educators (supports for teaching) and structures for students (supports for learning). The RPP produced PD and facilitation materials that leverage CS/CT and design thinking to address inequities in student access to broader educational supports. 3) <strong><em>Curricular improvements:</em></strong> The RPP educators revised the content and activities that shape students&rsquo; learning experiences. The RPP produced PD materials to support educators as they re-design content, activities, or both and leverage CS/CT approaches in the process.
