<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Understanding and supporting graduate education policies and practices is crucial to maintaining a well-trained workforce in the US, particularly for careers that require a PhD in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Within this mandate it is essential that all persons, regardless of background, are included in STEM training at the PhD level.  Among STEM disciplines, physics has shown persistent issues regarding representation of persons from diverse backgrounds. This project will assess current reforms in a US-based graduate physics and astronomy program to understand their impacts on studentsâ€™ educational experiences and success. The results of this study will be used to refine the program at the University of Utah and to develop best practices that can be adopted nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the 2018-19 academic year, admissions into the Physics &amp; Astronomy graduate program at the University of Utah was halted while a complete overhaul of all aspects of the program was initiated by the Department.  The program reform included the recruitment and admissions process, orientation and teaching assistant training, advising practices and other student support, the curriculum, and the exam structure. The first incoming class of graduate students has now entered the new program and are navigating these new policies and practices. The investigators will conduct a qualitative semi-ethnographic study on the experiences and outcomes of graduate students under the newly revised graduate program. This will be done by conducting multiple interviews with the new cohort of students throughout their first year in the program. Additionally, open ended survey data will be collected from the legacy students in the program to understand their experiences under the previous policies. This will offer a pseudo-control group to further understand the changes created for students by the new policies.  In addition, the results will be the basis for a longitudinal study of graduate student experiences at the University of Utah, and will be disseminated to the broader community through the literature, conference presentations, and visits to other departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This study explored two components of a recently reformed graduate program in physics and astronomy: (1) how the reform (change) happened in the department and (2) the experiences of newly matriculated graduate students in the reformed program. This project employed in-depth conversational interviews with 33 participants and the written response of one participant who were involved or impacted by the change. Additionally, 20 more interviews were conducted with graduate students entering the reformed program. The results indicated significant support of the changes, in order to save the graduate program, and overall positive student experiences within the structures of the new policies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The change process in the department was leadership led, but continually informed by community input. A central executive committee (EC) was created to report to a newly appointed chair following the death of a student by suicide in the department. This death prompted a one-year pause of new graduate student admissions into the program, and a comprehensive program reform effort undertaken broadly by faculty and staff within the department. The EC continually sought input from department committees and community members in town hall settings, faculty meetings, and meetings with students. Beyond these formal channels, the EC also received informal input from e-mails and hallway conversations. Through this iterative process, the EC was able to pass new policies to recreate and rebuild the graduate program. Though the vast majority of participants reported favorable views of the policies, some concerns remained. In particular, some faculty and students were concerned that the internal climate within specific research groups may have not shifted significantly during the reforms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Student experiences in the newly formed graduate program were largely positive. The implementation of new practices, such as having students meet with their research committees with and without their dissertation chair, provided space for important dialogue about their experiences and progress within the program. However, some confusion remained about some program components, including advising processes for first-year graduate students who had not yet formed dissertation committees. In addition, roughly half of the interviewed students reported positive experiences with the first-semester comprehensive exam, while the other half found it to be difficult and unnecessary to prove their physics content knowledge. Lastly, the newly revised teaching assistant training provided to the students in the summer was experienced as being long and exhausting, but full of important pedagogical information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Through this study we build a model (image attached) of how the change process unfolded, and student experiences within it. A metaphor of a bond fire was also created to explain the change process. The spark that lit the fire was a tragedy, but the fire only burned because it was fueled by existing ideas and concerns (image attached). Largely, the success of the changes can be viewed as related to the imminent need of faculty to come together to save the graduate program. Despite the new policies and practices, cultural issues remain within the department and individual research groups. These changes, too, are ongoing. The program continues to be iteratively evaluated and improved to support student retention and success.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/07/2021<br>      Modified by: Ramon&nbsp;Barthelemy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2000328/2000328_10649463_1631028715764_ScreenShot2021-09-07at9.28.52AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2000328/2000328_10649463_1631028715764_ScreenShot2021-09-07at9.28.52AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Change Process"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2000328/2000328_10649463_1631028715764_ScreenShot2021-09-07at9.28.52AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Change Process"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The change process in the department</div> <div class="imageCredit">MacKenzie Lenz</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ramon&nbsp;Barthelemy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Change Process</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2000328/2000328_10649463_1631028827035_ScreenShot2021-09-07at9.32.35AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2000328/2000328_10649463_1631028827035_ScreenShot2021-09-07at9.32.35AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bond Fire Metaphor for Change"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2000328/2000328_10649463_1631028827035_ScreenShot2021-09-07at9.32.35AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bond Fire Metaphor for Change"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Metaphor for the change in the program, a fire of change sparked by tragedy and fueled by existing concerns and ideas</div> <div class="imageCredit">MacKenzie Lenz</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ramon&nbsp;Barthelemy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bond Fire Metaphor for Change</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
