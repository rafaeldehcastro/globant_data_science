<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea. Gravitational wave detections drive profound discoveries at nature’s extremes, opening new doors on previously hidden cosmic phenomena. New physics will arise from coincident electromagnetic or particle (such as neutrino) signatures of gravitational wave sources. The ability to discover the unexpected critically depends on a detailed understanding of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) and its myriads of data channels distinguishing the serendipitous astrophysics from the chance coincidence of noise. The Columbia Experimental Gravity group (GECo) aims to expand the reach of LIGO science by uncovering the seemingly serendipitous - be that a multimessenger discovery or concurrence of non-terrestrial signature in a network of gravitational-wave detectors – while also training the next generation of scientists and engineers. LIGO's high complexity provides a unique training ground in our era when the complexity of scientific and commercial instruments explodes and the availability of highly trained STEM minds is needed to keep pace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravitational waves provide an unprecedented opportunity born of new data to expose cosmic puzzles using multiple astrophysical messengers. At the root of discovery is an in-depth understanding of the multifaceted interplay between the instruments and innovative data analysis approaches relying on all accessible data and auxiliary channels, while also keeping an eye on the comprehensive mesh of cosmic messengers. On the instrumental frontier, GECo will study noise transients and their connection to detector anomalies. Using collected gravitational wave trigger events, GECo will provide statistical inference on possible source populations, among others, in the context of multimessenger astrophysics. GECo will carry out astrophysics searches, using multiple cosmic messengers besides GWs with emphasis on high energy-neutrinos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Each gravitational-wave detection up to date provided additional insights into mergers of compact objects, such as black holes and neutron stars. Additionally, the process of working with gravitational-wave detector data also gives a deeper understanding of how the instruments’ sensitivity factors into gravitational-wave observations. The Columbia Experimental Gravity group studied the properties of gravitational wave events, in combination with each other, as well as with other types of astrophysical observations (such as high-energy neutrinos), and studied how instrumental noise can bias detection results.   Among others, we studied how the physical configuration and the noise power present in the LIGO detectors can yield a higher signal-to-noise ratio and thus bias (favor) certain astrophysical sources. We devised a method, requiring a million times less computational resources than previous ones, for estimating observational bias and used it for the first unmodelled inference on the mass distribution of binary black holes, which showed interesting extra features.   Three black holes can become gravitationally bound. As they evolve, two successive mergers can occur. In such a hierarchical merger ‘family’, the black holes involved are directly related to each other which can be tested via gravitational-wave observations. We searched existing LIGO-Virgo data for related binary black hole merger pairs and identified plausible candidates.   New physics can also arise from coincident electromagnetic or particle (such as neutrino) signatures of gravitational wave sources. We developed the optimal model-dependent multimessenger search method that can be used for any number of messengers, can work with subthreshold triggers, and can assume any model and searched for gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino coincidences using these optimal methods and archival catalogs.   The Columbia group has a strong outreach program driven by enthusiasm to share astrophysical results with a broad and diverse public. Group members efficiently promoted the excitement, potential, and recognition of gravitational-wave science in multiple forms. The group worked with a diverse body of high-school students from New York area schools in addition to undergraduates. These motivated young people got much-needed encouragement/opportunity, critical exposure to research, and inspiration for future careers in science, technology, and math.
