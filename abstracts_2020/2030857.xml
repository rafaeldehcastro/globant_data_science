<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[A major critical gap in fighting the spread of COVID-19 has been (and will continue to be) the availability of safe and fast, point-of-care testing devices to rapidly detect infection by SARS-CoV-2.  To this end, the vision of this project is to design and construct a portable optical platform to identify the presence of a virus in real time.  The objective of developing this novel platform is to provide a robust prototype to identify viruses in a few minutes, with larger than 90 % accuracy. The project will integrate three different technologies, independently developed at Penn State University and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), to establish feasibility of mass production and deployment of such a device.  Potentially this device could also in the future be used to identify other, new emerging viruses and quickly mitigate outbreaks and pandemics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of virologists, data scientists, space scientists and spectroscopists will leverage existing JPL technology developed for the detection of water on the surface of the Moon, combined with a carbon nanotube, virus enrichment platform, in conjunction with a novel 2D metal surface able to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of virus Raman spectra.  Researchers will then obtain the Raman signature of different coronaviruses and will develop a robust data repository and machine learning models that can be used to store and process Raman spectra in real-time from different locations. The goal of this effort is to enable the quick identification of viruses in a label-free manner, with high sensitivity and specificity - this means no specific antibodies or polymerase chain reaction would be necessary for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Development of these new capabilities will provide insights into material, surface-virus interactions, the fundamentals of the Raman spectra of viruses and machine learning models for virus identification via Raman spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Our project aims at integrating three technologies that have been independently developed at Penn State and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)-Caltech. These merged technologies will result in a novel portable platform for fast optical detection (&lt; 5 min) of viruses, including the human SARS-CoV-2. The disposable cartridges designed and developed in the project is coupled to a handheld highly-sensitive Raman spectrometer, which is being developed to detect water molecules on planetary targets such as Moon. This proposal will demonstrate the feasibility and integration of the technologies according to the vision described above and depicted in Fig. 1.</p> <p>Our<strong> </strong>system is a portable detection device with disposable cartridges consisting of carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays and two-dimensional (2D) metals, able to enrich and quickly identify viruses (&lt; 5 min), using an ultra-miniaturized high-sensitivity Raman spectrometer. The device-spectrometer system collects Raman spectra from patient samples, and these spectra contain the fingerprint of different viruses and strains, including SARS-CoV-2. The data will be stored in real-time in a data repository in a 5G cloud, and in conjunction with machine learning (ML) models, the viruses will be accurately identified (Fig. 1). Because of the instrument's high sensitivity implemented by the presence of 2D metals, the signal to noise (S/N) ratio of the Raman spectra collected from patients will be significantly enhanced with virus identification accuracies &gt; 95%. Furthermore, the enriched viruses trapped within the CNT/2D metal cartridges can be used for genomic analysis via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). These portable devices could be deployed anywhere in the world, including in hospitals, airports, schools, companies, and border checkpoints. Moreover, these cartridges could also be used to culture viruses using different cell lines and help in the development of vaccines.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>We have successfully collected a wide range of viruses with our established potable device, known as VIRRION (Virus capture with Rapid Raman spectroscopy detection and Identification) platform. A schematic demonstration of the VIRRION platform constructed with carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays and gold (Au) nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 2. The viruses are enriched while flowing through the size-controllable CNT arrays, and the viruses with suitable size are trapped inside the CNT arrays where the Au nanoparticles are pre-deposited (shown in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image). Then the Raman spectra are collected from the virus-enriched samples, of which the representative ones are shown in Fig 2. The capture and enrichment of viruses from clinical samples based on this microfluidic platform could further amplify the Raman signals via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy that is sensitive to surface proteins and other components of viruses. The input to such a device can be virus cultures, saliva, nasal washes, or even exhaled breath. The output of the device is the Raman spectra of captured viruses.</p> <p>The dataset of Raman spectra has been acquired consisting of three groups of RNA viruses, and &nbsp;multiple strains of the same virus. We implemented several machine learning algorithms to conduct classification to differentiate the viruses, and among them, the ResNet-based CNN model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 82.2%.</p> <p>The JPL team designed a portable Raman spectrometer and have built a 3D prototype demo for the concept and feasibility study. Fig. 3 shows the difference between a standard Raman spectrometer and the SHS Raman spectrometer. For Raman SHS spectrometer, the resolution and sensitivity does not depend on the distance between the gratings and the beam splitter and instead it depends on the angles between them and the size of the gratings (in the order of 1-5 cm). Therefore RSHS can be more compact and provides higher spectral resolution for a narrow targeted wavelength (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows a cost-effective R-SHS prototype for 850 nm.
