<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Oil-water systems are commonplace and form the basis of numerous processes in industries such as pharmaceuticals, food, cosmetics, agrochemicals, and nanomaterials. Not all interactions between oil and water are beneficial, especially in situations such as oil spills in oceans. Although recent investigations have probed different facets of oil spillages, several questions remain unanswered. As an example, the process by which oil droplets impacting on the ocean surface eventually spread to form thin films is not well understood.   This project will elucidate this process in detail using a combination of experiments and mathematical models. The proposed research is transformative as it has the potential to probe new pathways for oil spill proliferation, and it will shed light on involved processes that have been largely overlooked. The results should expand the understanding on oil spills by providing a comprehensive experimental data and a validated theoretical framework that can inform better containment strategies. The knowledge gained can be applied to other oil/water systems such as separation/extraction columns or thin films. The  project's findings will be disseminated through outreach programs and presentations at national and international conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aftermaths of a dewetting event at liquid-air interface by an oil droplet will strongly depend upon the chemical properties of these oils, the bulk liquid properties, and the presence of particles within these oil drops. Consequently, the research will use simulant clay particles with the auxiliary objective of devising a method to arrest the spreading. Post a dewetting event, the research will study the spreading behavior of oils in absence and presence of microparticles and such behavior will be quantified in the form of dimensionless groups to classify the predict behavior of the spreading oil. The data collected from this investigation should also help develop more accurate drop size distribution models. The investigation will touch upon diverse fields such as interfacial fluid science of thin liquid film/drops and synthesis of colloids. The possible control of dewetting by microparticles could also lead to methods for formulating Pickering emulsions which could then find novel uses within many disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Such processes may have preceded life on earth itself and continues to this day through natural/artificial oil seepages. Since these processes are a primary source of environmental pollution in oceans, seas, and other water bodies, they have been extensively studied by a gamut of researchers which includes marine biologists, ecologists, oceanographers, fluid mechanicians and climatologists. Although this field has been heavily researched, we have identified a phenomenon integral to every event of an oil drop breaching the water surface and forming an oil slick that had gone unnoticed till now. We report observations on&nbsp;<em>bursting of a drop at a liquid/air interface</em>&nbsp;that occurs in the aftermath of an oil drop gently rising in a bulk fluid and impacting an air/water interface. We show that an oil drop doesn&rsquo;t always directly transition to forming an oil slick, but it can counter-intuitively also form daughter drops within the bulk liquid through a fascinating&nbsp;<em>jetting reversal</em>&nbsp;depending upon the oil viscosity. The existence of this novel phenomenon, hidden in plain sight, has huge implications towards addressing problems related to water pollution as it posits a completely new pathway by which oil dispersions could proliferate within water bodies.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit</span></strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>This research delved into uncovering the intricate dynamics of oil drops impacting a liquid/air interface from below, offering insights into several previously unexplored phenomena. The investigation encompassed a comprehensive examination of various oils and glycerol-water solutions, scrutinizing their influence on the formation of reverse jets/droplets underneath the interface, and unearthed how the jetting reversal within the bulk fluid (parallel to gravity) engenders a daughter droplet which then undergoes a cascade of similar events until it forms a slick atop the water surface. Furthermore, the study unveils the captivating connection between oil droplet collapse and capillary wave generation, shedding light on how these features are intricately linked to bulk liquid properties, particularly viscosity. The establishment of a regime map and the development of a rigorous mathematical model based on hydrodynamic instability analysis represent crucial contributions, providing a framework to theoretically predict and substantiate the observed phenomena. Additionally, the research unveils the scaling dependence of daughter droplet size on bulk liquid and explores the intriguing role of particles within oil droplets in altering dewetting dynamics, offering valuable insights into the controllability of such processes. Altogether, these findings advance our understanding of complex fluid dynamics and offer a solid foundation for future research in this domain.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impact:&nbsp;</span></strong>Our studies have potentially opened new avenues of research into droplets collapsing at interfaces, with implications spanning diverse fields including oceanography, climatology, meteorology, ecology, oil recovery and drug delivery. Moreover, by training a diverse group of students, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, in advanced fluid mechanics techniques and experimental skills, this study contributed to fostering a more inclusive scientific community. In particular, the studies provide a new pathway of how droplets may form in oceans that has been unknown till now. We expect that the droplet size relations obtained from this work will enhance the available droplet distribution models and make them more accurate for oil spill disaster management for improved containment and remediation strategies, thereby safeguarding marine ecosystems and coastal communities. Lastly, our cross-disciplinary approach extends the impact of our work to fields such as pharmaceuticals and climate change research, offering new possibilities for drug delivery systems and contributing to climate modeling and mitigation efforts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/14/2023<br>      Modified by: Sushant&nbsp;Anand</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2028571/2028571_10675892_1694648827826_FinalImage02--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2028571/2028571_10675892_1694648827826_FinalImage02--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bursting of air bubbles and oil drops at the air-water interface"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2028571/2028571_10675892_1694648827826_FinalImage02--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bursting of air bubbles and oil drops at the air-water interface"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A, C.
