<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will determine the mechanisms by which cell surface vimentin modulates the cellular uptake of the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2). Vimentin is an intermediate filament that forms part of the cellular cytoskeleton. New evidence indicates that vimentin is present on the extracellular surface of cells and plays a critical role in the binding and uptake of multiple viruses; yet, the mechanisms by which this happens remain unclear. Identifying the factors that regulate cell surface vimentin and how it interacts with SARS2 will provide new insight into new functions of cell surface vimentin and the fundamental mechanisms by which viruses infect cells. There is an urgent need for this information as we have an incomplete understanding of how this virus enters the cell.  This project integrates techniques from physics, engineering, chemistry, and biology and will broaden participation in the field of biophysics by providing interdisciplinary training for graduate students and postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Host cell entry of SARS2 is not yet fully characterized, but inhibition of both endocytosis and direct fusion are known to be preventative. SARS2 makes use of a spike protein to interact with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor to drive host cell entry via membrane fusion. The membrane fusion pathway for SARS2 is, therefore, similar to SARS-CoV (SARS), the virus that genetically most closely resembles SARS2. Endocytosis is another dominant pathway for host cell entry, but the mechanisms involved remains largely unknown. Previous studies indicate that SARS host cell entry via endocytosis critically involves cell surface vimentin. This project aims to determine the role of cell surface vimentin in SARS2 cellular uptake. This project pursues the following three objectives: 1) determine the presence and the factors that regulate extracellular vimentin using fibroblasts and lung epithelial cells; 2) study the effect of extracellular vimentin on SARS2 viral uptake and determine whether viral uptake can be blocked by anti-vimentin antibodies; and 3) quantify the molecular interaction between vimentin and the spike protein of SARS2. These studies will be conducted using SARS2 virus-like particles. Results from molecular dynamics simulations will provide an interpretative framework for the experimental results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is made by the Cellular Dynamics and Functionl Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The central goal this project is to understand how extracellular vimentin modulates host cell invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Viral host cell invasion is an essential step of viral disease and typically proceeds via a central ligand-cell surface receptor binding event. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein&nbsp;binds the primary host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Once bound to the cell surface, the virus invades the cell through a series of membrane remodeling and fusion events. We have identified a novel entry partner for SARS-CoV-2, extracellular vimentin, and showed that this interaction can be targeted by anti-vimentin antibodies to reduce host cell invasion in human cell lines. Extracellular vimentin is an obscure form of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin, which is found on the outer surface of the cell plasma membrane. Extracellular vimentin has been implicated as a binding partner for different viruses and bacteria, facilitating their uptake into the cell. Our results showed that vimentin is a binding partner for the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and that antibodies against vimentin can block up to 80% of host cell invasion of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in human cell lines. To provide an interpretive framework for our results, we developed a new three-dimensional computational model of SARS-CoV-2, the cell membrane, and extracellular vimentin. This model captures the main features of membrane wrapping, treating extracellular vimentin as a co-receptor that mediates cell-virus interactions, which can be applied more generally to understand endocytosis and membrane wrapping at length scales much larger than the virus. This study moves the field forward by highlighting the significance that extracellular vimentin plays in viral invasion and revealing its potential as a therapeutic target. Our results provide a critical foundation for the future development of drugs targeting vimentin against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses that manipulate vimentin to invade cells.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/01/2022<br>      Modified by: Alison&nbsp;E&nbsp;Patteson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2032861/2032861_10675876_1653602968809_figure-1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2032861/2032861_10675876_1653602968809_figure-1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Extracellular Vimentin"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2032861/2032861_10675876_1653602968809_figure-1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Extracellular Vimentin"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Intra and extracellular vimentin staining in a mouse embryo fibroblast</div> <div class="imageCredit">Maxx Swoger and Alison Patteson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alison&nbsp;E&nbsp;Patteson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Extracellular Vimentin</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2032861/2032861_10675876_1653603106685_Figure-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2032861/2032861_10675876_1653603106685_Figure-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Antivimentin antibodies block uptake of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2032861/2032861_10675876_1653603106685_Figure-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Antivimentin antibodies block uptake of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Extracellular vimentin serves as an attachment factor for SARS-CoV-2 and antivimentin antibodies block uptake of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in human epithelial cell lines in vivo</div> <div class="imageCredit">Maxx Swoger and Alison Patteson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alison&nbsp;E&nbsp;Patteson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Antivimentin antibodies block uptake of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2032861/2032861_10675876_1653603222401_figure-3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2032861/2032861_10675876_1653603222401_figure-3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Extracellular attachment factors facilitate cell membrane wrapping"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2032861/2032861_10675876_1653603222401_figure-3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Extracellular attachment factors facilitate cell membrane wrapping"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Snapshot of a coarse-grain computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cell membrane, and extracellular attachment factors</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sarthak Gupta, Alison Patteson, J.
