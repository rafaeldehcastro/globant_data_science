<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative:  National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center).  The focus of a spectrum research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum. Olin College of Engineering, a global leader in engineering education and curriculum innovation, proposes to establish the Olin Spectrum Innovation Initiative Center (OSIIC) as a hub that brings together commercial and government expertise with academic collaboration to not only transform wireless education and technology, but to share innovative academic approaches and wireless curriculum design with institutions on a global scale. Following the guidelines outlined in the Presidential Memorandum on Spectrum Sustainability, the OSIIC team will explore techniques to revolutionize the current educational paradigm in the field of wireless communications and spectrum management, and experiment with an academic model that is grounded in real-world, project based learning with apprenticeship-styled educational experiences. These techniques and models will cultivate learning experiences that create educational, social, and financial value, and in turn, serve as a framework to create replicable, systemic educational change that strengthens the higher education financial model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the duration of the OSIIC Planning Grant, Olin College, and specifically the Olin Satellite + Spectrum Technology and Policy (OSSTP) Group will continue to identify potential partners, further hone the research and educational agendas and develop the initial team to ultimately submit a full Center proposal. Key agendas for the full Center will include 1) real-world project-based wireless curriculum development, 2) fundamental long-term spectrum research, 3) fostering entrepreneurial opportunities and environments for wireless communications ventures, and 4) encouraging organizational collaboration between academia, industry and government agencies.  Examples of spectrum sharing research themes that have been identified as fundamental focus areas for the OSIIC include advanced antenna and waveform technologies to enable the coexistence of inter/intra system 5G and satellite network topologies and novel methods for spectrum sharing, coordination and interference mitigation like fast steering and patterning high-gain beams for interference rejection. In addition to the curriculum development for traditional undergraduate institutions. The OSIIC will also organize workshops, short courses, seminars, and other lifelong learning opportunities for K-12 and post-graduate audiences. This endeavor along with the collaborative educational, research, and entrepreneurial undertakings of the OSIIC will comprehensively train, develop, and refine the skills of a modern, talented workforce ready to tackle the challenges of the rapidly evolving landscape of wireless communications.  After the review, this project was modified to increase its focus on the broader impacts portion of the project, especially curriculum development, curating environment conducive to workforce development, and forging new alliances between public and private entities to strengthen workforce and educational systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Whitney Lohmeyer has completed research and coordination efforts for the "Olin Spectrim Innovation Initiative Center (OSIIC)" supported by the NSF Spectrum Innovation Initiative (SII) Planning Grant. During her funding period, she spent twelve months at Olin College developing a full SII Center Proposal, which involved working with undergraduate researchers piloting future research projects on interference mitigation and coexistence solutions, developing wireless communications curriculum, investigating real-world apprenticeship-styled learning experiences, and merging efforts with other NSF SII Planning Grant recipients like CU Boulder, Notre Dame, and UVA to define the vision, and ultimately submit a proposal for the NSF SII Center: SpectrumX.    Dr. Lohmeyer accomplished the goal of piloting undergraduate research programs, which focused on satellite communications systems design and interference mitigation, and on creating Wireless Communications curriculum materials. To elaborate further, her research projects included the following:    Equivalent Power Flux Density (EPFD) Validation Simulation Tool: A team of six undergraduate students researched the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)’s Article 22 EPFD Limits and wrote software to validate the compliance of non-geostationary systems (NGSO) against the Article 22 EPFD limits. This work aimed to quantify, and ultimately mitigate, the interference environment into existing geostationary systems (GSOs) and passive science users like radioastronomy (RAS).    FCC Auction Analysis: Under the mentorship of Summit Ridge Group (SRG), a team of undergraduate students researched FCC Auction 107 (C-Band) and compared results with Auctions 101, 102, 103, 105, and 1000 to better understand auction dynamics and trends.   Antenna Control Unit (ACU): Under the mentorship of Mangata Networks, a private sector company aiming to launch a constellation of medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites, a team of undergraduate seniors designed an antenna control unit (ACU) and is currently drafting a paper for publication on their design process and rationale.   Link Budget Assessment Tool: Students designed a python-based link budget calculator that computes propagation loss in accordance with ITU Standards and checks compliance with ITU Article 21 Power Flux Density (PFD) Limits. This tool allows for the design and validation of link budgets.   L-Band Smallsat Downlink Validation: Under the mentorship of Othernet, a team of undergraduate students utilized the Link Budget Assessment Tool to develop and validate a downlink link budget for an L-band receiver from a small satellite transmitter over bandwidths ranging from 20 kHz to 5000 kHz and PA RF output power ranging from 8 mW to 2W in order to  document receiver performance (in terms of SNR and data rate) using a commercial patch antenna and a helical antenna.    Antenna / NGSO Papers: A team of undergraduate students researched and published two papers on Ku-/Ka- band user terminals in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems in the publicly available Microwave Journal. "Antenna Performance Specifications for Ka-/Ku-band User Terminals in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellite Communications Systems" analyzed common antenna performance specifications, whereas "A Description and Comparison of Modern Flat Panel Antenna Technology for Ku-/Ka-band User Terminals in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellite Communications Systems" analyzed the landscape of current flat-panel antennas used in user terminal technologies for LEO constellations.  These papers aimed to create a common resource for antenna designers and individuals interested in learning about today’s phased array technology.     Course and curriculum development for Analog and Digital Communications, Principles of Wireless Communication, Satellite Systems, and Resonance!: Antenna Theory centered on creating textbooks and coursework (including examples, problem sets, labs, and exams with fully documented solutions and instructor notes) and was led by undergraduate students who had completed the respective courses with student reviewers who had not completed the courses. Furthermore, a paper on an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) laboratory in the Principles of Wireless Communications course was written and will be submitted for publication in the IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference..   Lohmeyer’s research at Olin College of Engineering along with her previous and continued private sector experience working in satellite communications systems design and regulatory compliance form the basis for her contribution as a member of the full SpectrumX NSF Center Proposal. In addition to the aforementioned work, Dr. Lohmeyer spent the duration of the funding period working alongside other SpectrumX planning grant recipients identifying future research projects, like the coexistence of megaconstellations and passive science users like radioastronomy, and determining how best the center would interact with the ITU, the US Delegation to the ITU, and industry. Ultimately, the SpectrumX Center will serve as an important contribution to the field of wireless communications and spectrum management.
