<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic the state of Hawaii, being an archipelago, is in an exclusive position to carry out measures no other state could do â€” it essentially sealed its borders to virtually all travel-related infections including inter-island ones by instituting a two-week quarantine of incoming air, water, and inter-island passengers, thus providing a critical data set that can help researchers understand the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of mitigation and isolation strategies. Hawaii also tracks the currently limited arrivals onto the various islands, and this collection of information will continue as mitigation levels change. This project will use the unique data from Hawaii to provide a predictive understanding of the virus through modeling of spread and mitigation effects, focusing on a critical gap in understanding variability of COVID-19 spread within different communities and a lack of dynamic modeling. Incorporation of data sets from a controlled environment will greatly enhance predictive understanding and enable mitigation approaches with better certainty based on real data. The project will use advanced computational techniques to make the models run efficiently and make them readily available to the public and decision makers involved in the COVID-19 response strategy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many current COVID-19 models only consider a totality of the population of any given state/county and do not take into account patterns of spatial activities or specificity of the region under consideration. This project will implement new dynamic and computationally-optimized models that incorporate compartmentalized populations to study variability in the spread of the disease as well as rapidly changing mitigation strategies. These elastic models are easily adaptable to different environments and employable locally and around the world, thus helping to minimize the negative effects of COVID-19 on public health at a global level. Use of discrete compartmentalized epidemiological models, as well as models based on spatio-temporal stochastic processes, can take into account different population communities distinguished through a variety of attributes that potentially affect the susceptibility of individuals to the disease. Such enhanced granularity will improve predictive capability of the models and provide better insights into the spread of COVID-19. The project will also engage students thus providing training for the future generation of researchers in data-driven sciences using a critical and urgent topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by CCF Division Software and Hardware Foundations Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

However, such models cannot be used as off-the-shelf tools - they need careful calibration for a specific virus as well as a specific region under consideration. Using the fact that the Hawaiian Islands represent a largely controlled environment due to the geographically isolated&nbsp; borders and mostly uniform pandemic-induced governmental controls and restrictions, this project studied whether demographic and spatial heterogeneity of Hawaiian counties have a significant effect on the spread of the disease. In addition, we investigated the question of what type of a mathematical model is most appropriate for a given situation.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">First, our work highlights that despite being a part of the same archipelago and having similar protocols for mitigation measures, different Hawaiian counties exhibit quantifiably different dynamics of the spread of the disease. It also shows interesting similarities between some Hawaiian counties and other archipelagos and islands. We pay special attention to details of the heterogeneity effects to discern what level of granularity and detail is appropriate for making policy decisions related to curtailing disease spread. Our results suggest that mitigation measures should be more localized, that is, targeting the county level rather than the state level if the counties are reasonably insulated from one another. We also notice that the spread of the disease is very sensitive to unexpected events and certain changes in mitigation measures. An important conclusion of our research is the identification of patterns that change extremely rapidly. This is due primarily to the nonlinear behavior of the underlying equations that simulate the spread of the pandemic. We find that it is critical to ensure that heterogeneity is included in modeling and, consequently, in decision making for adequate and effective pandemic control. We have received the Best Paper Award from a well-known International Conference (9th Global Health 2020) where we remotely presented our first results early on in the pandemic.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Second, in the literature numerous types of models have been employed with various levels of success.&nbsp; We focus on two widely used types of models: equation-based models (such as standard compartmental epidemiological models) and agent-based models. We show that when it comes to information crucial to decision making, both models produce very similar results. Rather than treating the two models as two distinct ways to obtain the same results we should exploit advantages of both throughout a pandemic simulation, particularly when the simulation is used in a predictive real-time fashion.&nbsp; We consider what can be learned from running both models side-by-side; taking&nbsp; and&nbsp; applying&nbsp; the&nbsp; best&nbsp; of&nbsp; each&nbsp; model&nbsp; using&nbsp; the&nbsp; measured&nbsp; data. We&nbsp; also analyze the conceptual and computational requirements of each of the models for this particular test-bed population.
