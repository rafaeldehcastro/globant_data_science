<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Our current economic model is linear; we take, make, and waste products.  This take-make-waste model has led to serious environmental problems from using too many resources to creating too much waste, including vast amounts of plastic waste into our oceans. In contrast with the take-make-waste or linear model is the circular economy.  The ideas behind the circular economy include keeping products in use, eliminating waste and pollution by design, and aiming to help nature.  The circular economy is making progress in Europe and Asia, but progress in the United States is lagging.  Through this project, we are hosting a workshop, aiming to create a much-needed research agenda for design for circular economy in the United States.  We also are aiming to create a curriculum for design for circular economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current linear consumption model of raw material extraction, production, use, and disposal dominates the global economy. Today, we clearly see that this linear model has led to serious unintended global consequences from resource depletion to global waste, spanning all industrial sectors, from plastics to the built environment. In contrast to linear models, circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from resource consumption by cycling products and materials back into production, either by returning materials to generate new products, or by releasing benign substances to the environment through degradation. To achieve – or even begin to achieve – a circular economy, a convergent research approach needs to be employed as a multitude of disciplines -- from chemistry, biology, engineering, business, economics, social sciences, and behavioral science need to work in concert for circularity. Our vision is to foster and catalyze circular economy design from molecules to the built environment. Through this proposed workshop, we aim to develop the much-needed research agenda for design for circular economy from molecules to the built environment. Ultimately from a societal perspective – nationally and internationally, we address the pressing challenges of spiraling global waste and resource consumption. We are also aiming to address NSF’s Growing Convergence Research, one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments, by integrating diverse disciplines through curated workshop activities. Our workshop includes a strong training sub-theme for our community to create a curriculum for design for circular economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The current linear consumption model of raw material extraction, production, use, and disposal dominates the global economy. Today, we clearly see that this linear model has led to serious unintended global consequences from resource depletion to global waste, spanning all industrial sectors, from plastics to the built environment.  In contrast to linear models, circular economy (CE) aims to decouple economic growth from resource consumption by cycling products and materials back into production, either by returning materials to generate new products, or by releasing benign substances to the environment through degradation. CE principles are based on the efficient use of resources and eliminating waste from product life cycles; a truly circular economy keeps material in continuous use by design.  Our vision was to foster and catalyze circular economy design from molecules to the built environment.  We held, for the first time in the US, a virtual workshop, NSF Convergence Accelerator: Workshop on Design for a Circular Economy from Molecules to the Built Environment (NSF Award No. 2035223).  We convened an expansive group of 95 experts to ultimately aid in creating a research agenda and the mission components in support of a new track for the NSF Convergence Accelerator program. Attendees included academia from engineering to the social sciences, industry, non-profits, government agencies, foundations, and end-users. The virtual workshop was facilitated by KnowInnovation and took place over three, three-hour sessions, over three weeks: September 18, 24, 30, 2020.    Through three highly curated agendas with a mix of keynotes, provocations, and pointed questions, we identified key Jupiter shots, anticipated 10-year and 3-year transformative and scientific impacts, focused on the societal impacts for the American people and beyond, and mapped what can be accomplished within the 1-3 year timeline given the right ecosystem in the convergence accelerator.   The upswell of ideas, plans, and enthusiasm encouraged us that design for circular economy is at the precipice of innovation, technology, and positive and equitable societal outcomes.  Investing in this area is both prudent and urgent, so the U.S. can be leaders and innovators in design for circular economy.  Major findings of the workshop were the following:  *Design for circular economy is primed to be accelerated using a convergence research approach.  Parts of the CE ecosystem are in place in the US from people to industries and innovation, but it is fragmented and at varying degrees of sophistication. For example, the chemical industry is working towards incremental aspects of the circular economy but is lagging in terms of a transformative shift of an entire sector. The built environment is also lagging, yet truly has the potential to shift from a sector that provides products to a sector that provides services.   Additionally, the number of people, companies, decision makers, and researchers identified in the workshop further emphasizes the need for a cohort of people to coalesce around advancing design for CE in the US.  Through our workshop series, we have developed partnerships and are continuing to foster the design for CE community in the US through on-line mechanisms, and a convergence accelerator can further foster this community.  *There is an urgent need to educate and train not only the next generation of scientists and engineers on design for circular economy, but also anyone that does any type of design &ndash; from the business developer who is working on designing financing strategies to policy makers who are designing circular economy interventions.  We view design for circular economy as an ideal mechanism to foster and inspire the re-invention of educational approaches.  We need to understand the cognitive barriers to fostering a circular economy and then develop strategies to overcome those barriers by exploring interdependent/independent mindsets, fundamental decision processes, and systems thinking.   *There is an urgent need for circular economy principles, standards, tools, and metrics across all levels of the supply chain. These concepts should ensure, measure, and make transparent environmental gains; prosperous, triple bottom line circle economies at multiple scales (national, state, local, and micro); and foster meaningful and deep equity and inclusion. The overall vision is to a create transparent, multi-level shared database and tools used by product designers, brands, infrastructure planners and organizations/households to make decisions that move towards circular material choices and products/lifestyles.  *We need to reimagine and transform how we design across all levels -- from molecules (e.g., function-property and ecotoxicity), to materials (e.g., polymers, electronics, paper products), and to the built environment (e.g, design for value and reversible building design) and envision the end-of-life and/or re-use from the cradle to the grave using systems tools (e.g., life cycle assessment, techno-economic analysis) to guide the design.  Through this proposed workshop, we aimed to develop the research agenda for design for circular economy from molecules to the built environment.  From a societal perspective, we aimed to address the pressing challenge of spiraling global waste and resource consumption.
