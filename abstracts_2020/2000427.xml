<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Symposium is a top-tier venue for cybersecurity and privacy research, and has been for much of its 40-plus-year history. Student attendance at S&amp;P is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity. The 2020 Symposium will be held in San Francisco, CA and consist of approximately 80 technical papers and Systematization of Knowledge papers, which provide valuable background to students who are learning the literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage participation in the IEEE Symposium and its Student Program Committee by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The major goal of this project is to support U.S.-based students or U.S. citizens studying abroad who are interested in attending the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, but who will not be able to attend without the support from the travel award.   As the flagship conference for computer security research, the Symposium provides a premier venue for the exchange of ideas between the best security and privacy researchers, developers, and practitioners.  Participation in symposia like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading-edge work in the field.  The support requested in this proposal enabled the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.    With the support of these grants, we were able to support the participation of 38 students in 2020, 62 students in 2021, and 15 students in 2022.    These students were also given the opportunity to participate in mentoring sessions, where senior researchers and faculty offered to meet with students, and students would then have a one-on-one conversation with these mentors.   Our goal is to support students and give them opportunities to improve their exposure to security topics and to increase their network of professional contacts.   With the help of the student travel grants targeting students who might not have been able to attend without this support, we are increasing the opportunities for professional development for graduate and undergraduate students interested in security.
