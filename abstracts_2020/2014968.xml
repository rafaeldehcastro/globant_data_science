<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is to benefit from a global network of proposed sensors continuously monitoring the worldâ€™s oceans at unprecedented scale. The need for better ocean sensing will benefit weather forecasting and fisheries management. Predicting hurricane strength is difficult when the heat content of the ocean is not measured at high resolution. In addition, many fisheries are showing signs of change as fish migrate towards the poles. This project will provide ocean temperature data to weather forecasters, as well as information about commercially important fish species.  Applications include academia, government, fisheries, maritime shipping, energy, and the military. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will scale ocean observation by developing the technology required to enable deployment millions of inexpensive smart platforms (surface drifters and profiling buoys) using acoustics, motion sensors and AI to detect marine animals, track vessels, and measure oceanographic conditions. This project will develop and test low power, efficient artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to detect boats on a bottom-stationing profiler. This bottom-stationing profiler is designed to rest on the bottom to hold station, and then rise to the surface to transmit boat detection information over a satellite to a cloud computing system. This project includes a demonstration of monitoring boat visitation rates at artificial reefs in Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With catalytic funding from the NSF-SBIR program, Loggerhead Instruments was able to successfully develop Haikubox, a WiFi-connected device equipped with a trained neural network which classifies backyard birds using birdsong.  Like a haiku poem which evokes nature and seasonal change, each Haikubox carefully observes and records nature?s beauty and seasonality.  By purchasing a Haikubox, customers will join a network of acoustic listening stations that use artificial intelligence (AI) to identify bird species, and then share the collected acoustic and identification data with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for scientific research.  This will allow the Lab to monitor and analyze real-time data for patterns and changes to species? migration and nesting behaviors.    By tapping into the curiosity many people have about the natural world and presenting ornithology in a fun and non-threatening way, Haikubox will improve scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology.  The website?s clear and intuitive interface, easily interpreted graphics, links to useful information, and high-quality images will engage users in birdwatching and help them become more aware of and protective of their environment.  As citizen-scientists and thus important research partners with the Lab of Ornithology, customers will become invested in protecting their feathered visitors and thus motivated environmental stewards.  In addition, Haikubox will improve understanding of the important role science plays in environmental research among the general public, including women and those from underrepresented groups in STEM, and it will make science more understandable, tangible and valuable.  More scientifically literate citizens will be better consumers of scientific knowledge and supporters of scientific endeavors.   Haikubox designs continue to be beta tested, a critical step in the research and development process since what worked perfectly in the lab often is imperfect under real-world conditions. Haikubox prototypes have been tested in urban, suburban and rural areas, and around the country.  Most testers were extremely enthusiastic (?This is so cool!? and ?I?m loving this? were frequent reactions), sharing their excitement with friends who also became beta testers.  The product has undergone many changes including using an off-the-shelf plastic enclosure, hand-built birdhouse-like box, and an attractive prototype designed for faster and cheaper assembly.  The plastic enclosure has evolved over time as the Loggerhead team worked to protect the electronics from inclement weather and improve sound quality.  The hardware changed to make it more functional, user-friendly and economical, and the neural network was improved based on users? feedback and the process of crowdsourced labeling of sounds at individual Haikuboxes.  As a result, the team met the original objectives which included developing a cloud-based management system and crowdsourced system for use on a smartphone or computer, and development and field testing a system to detect and classify birdsong easily installed by a consumer.   Additionally, Loggerhead Instruments developed and field tested HaikuMarine stations capable of running a neural network designed to detect and identify sounds from marine mammals.  As with Haikubox locations, HaikuMarine stations are expected to be purchased and installed by consumers with acoustic data shared with non-profit and academic partners for research purposes.  HaikuMarine stations can be installed off a dock or seawall, with a hydrophone in the water to collect the acoustic data, and connected to the homeowner?s WiFi.  This is expected to remain a niche product, since scaling would be extremely challenging.  The team met the original objectives which included developing and field testing a neural network capable of running on a low power device.
