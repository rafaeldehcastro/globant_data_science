<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Millions are at risk of severe health issues and even death caused by coronavirus infection (COVID-19 disease). The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and an international public health emergency.  In response to this situation, Prof. Stanciu at Purdue University aims to design strategies that will result in a point-of-need testing platform for rapid, sensitive, and effective detection of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in saliva.  This project provides opportunity to students to conduct research that integrates electrochemistry, biology, and device design to increase fundamental knowledge for advancing biosensing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sensor design is based on the measurement of impedance changes upon specific hybridization of surface-immobilized nucleic acid probes with target viral RNA.  An important aim of this research is to understand the electrokinetics and fundamental science that strongly influence probe hybridization efficiency.  This information is critical for achieving rapid (minutes), highly selective, and highly sensitive detection of the viral RNA (without amplification) under physiological conditions. This biosensing platform can be integrated into field-deployable devices or remote monitoring systems connected to cellular networks that will transmit information to disease control centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The national RT-PCR protocols among various countries typically target the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 due to its highly conserved nature and few nucleotide changes over time.&nbsp;RT-PCR is highly sensitive and specific for detecting viral RNA by amplification of specific sequence regions.&nbsp;However, molecular diagnosis using RT-PCR presents some drawbacks, including expensive fluorescent tags, long processing time, tedious sample preparation, need for laboratory facilities, and manpower issues, limiting testing capacity during large-scale outbreaks.</p> <p class="Abstract">Our team investigated two-dimensional (2D) materials&nbsp;for&nbsp; their poteintial to rapidly detect SARS-CoV2 in saliva. Two-dimensional materials are of interest for the design of such biosensors because of their very high surface area, high electrical conductivity and ability to be decorated with functional virus capture molecules. Thus, we selected graphene and 2D Ti carbides for for inclusion in functional electrodes for SARS-CoV-2 rapid detection in saliva.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Abstract">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published two specific sequences of probes, 2019-nCoV_N-F and 2019-nCoV_N-R, for the purposes of identifying SARS-CoV-2 N gene. We integrated these recognition probes with 2D titanium carbides (MXenes with formula&nbsp;Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>&nbsp;) &nbsp;for the development of the COVID-19 sensors. To validate the presence of the ssDNA probes on the Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> surface, the current-voltage (IV) curves of the fabricated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> before and after probe DNA functionalization were recorded.&nbsp;The ssDNA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> sensors exhibit remarkable increases in currents upon adsorption of target DNA (SARS-CoV-2 N gene) over the concentration range from 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> copies/&mu;; by contrast, the Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> sensors without probe functionalization does not show any significant response to target DNA. These findings indicate that only the ssDNA functionalized Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> is sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 N gene.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Abstract">We also validated the selectivity of the ssDNA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> sensors by preparing and testing the oligonucleotide sequences from the closely related N genes of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, all having a concentration of 100 copies/&mu;L. The ssDNA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>&nbsp;biosensor showed almost no response to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV N genes, confirming that this platform has a sequence-specific recognition for SARS-CoV-2 N gene. The selectivity results also suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 N probes are highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N gene, demonstrating the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 N probes for detecting the N gene of SARS-CoV-2.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Abstract">In summary, we report on a facile functionalization strategy for 2D materials with probe DNA molecules through noncovalent adsorption, which eliminates expensive labeling steps and achieves sequence-specific recognition.

The fabricated sensors are able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 N gene with sensitive and rapid response, a detection limit below 100 copies/&mu;L in saliva, and high specificity when tested against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS.
