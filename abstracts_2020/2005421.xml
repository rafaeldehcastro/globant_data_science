<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Part 1&lt;br/&gt;Addressing global environmental issues involves working at the intersection of science and decision making. Graduate students and early career researchers who engage in environmental research, however, have few meaningful opportunities within academia to gain the knowledge and training on how their research can be employed for social innovation and collective impacts. PIs propose an innovative and immersive experience for students on communicating science for decision making through student-led presentations and outreach at an international United Nations meeting on international environmental issues. By coupling training and authentic, real world engagement, students will learn how to navigate environmental issues in decision making, gain intercultural and diplomacy skills and build professional networks. Communicating science to decision makers is a critical part of preparing graduate students and early career researchers. Using a team-based approach to build research presentations for decision makers can provide graduate students professional development opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;Team-based projects can bring together students from different institutional backgrounds as well as from different disciplines. Students from three different institutions have worked together on presentations to international negotiators at the COP25 on science topics related to their own research and tied to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the UN. These topics include carbon markets, atmospheric sciences, emerging technology, gender issues, biodiversity loss, green careers, and many others. Presenting data on complex environmental issues that combines disciplines such as geosciences, atmospheric sciences and environmental sciences will provide students with unique international and interdisciplinary experience. In addition, presenting research in an international context provides students with cross cultural experiences as students move into professional careers. Each student team conducted primary and secondary data gathering on topics related to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) so students experienced aligning research questions with policy target outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Attended by delegates and diplomats from over 200 countries and civil society, the annual COP is a unique opportunity for students in the sciences to both witness and participate in environmental negotiations. &nbsp;Each year at the COP, delegates participate in side events and discussions on climate and sustainability sciences in a multicultural setting and these events are attended by leading policy and decision makers from around the world. The International Travel Grant awarded to Colorado State University, Michigan Tech University and Vanderbilt University brought students together at COP25 in Madrid Spain, where they held panel discussions on research topics associated with the sustainable development goals. In addition, students presented at press conferences, observed high level negotiations, and met leading climate scientists from around the world. &nbsp;The opoprtunity for students to expand their professional networks and see the role of science in policy and decision making is unparalleled with any other convention on the global stage.</p> <p>The impact of this initial travel grant was profound. Several institutions of higher education gathered together while in Madrid to expand the model of multi-institution partnerships into a five-year network focused on providing both the science of climate change and the intercultural perspectives of global policy making. &nbsp;Ten institutions developed and submitted a succesful Research Coordination Network in Undergraduate Biology Education (RCN-UBE) to bring students to future COPs as delegates and participants in international negotiations. Such experiences change students perceptions of environmental policy, international communication and negotiation, and deepens their understanding of multiple ways of knowing sciences and multi-cultural perspectives on climate action and solutions. The broader impacts of the inital travel grant includes providing students from diverse backgrounda view of &nbsp; international professional opportunities including USAID and International NGOs as career paths in the sciences. &nbsp;Several students have gone on to explore careers in international and sustainability sciences with a much better understanding of the role of culture and different ways of knowing sciences and social equity as part of the international environmental frameworks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/26/2022<br>      Modified by: Gillian&nbsp;Bowser</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2005421/2005421_10647174_1664245097733_IMG_9053--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2005421/2005421_10647174_1664245097733_IMG_9053--rgov-800width.jpg" title="student delegate for RINGO"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2005421/2005421_10647174_1664245097733_IMG_9053--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="student delegate for RINGO"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students participating in negotiations with Research and Independent non-government organization (RINGO) at COP25</div> <div class="imageCredit">g. bowser</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gillian&nbsp;Bowser</div> <div class="imageTitle">student delegate for RINGO</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2005421/2005421_10647174_1664244880206_IMG_9021--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2005421/2005421_10647174_1664244880206_IMG_9021--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student presentation team"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2005421/2005421_10647174_1664244880206_IMG_9021--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student presentation team"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students from a multi-institutional research team presented their research at COP25</div> <div class="imageCredit">G.
