<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will investigate the gap between the science of epidemic modeling and risk communication to the general public in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the rapid development of information, communication, and technologies, new data acquisition and assessment methods are needed to evaluate the risk of epidemic transmission and geographic spreading from the community perspective, to help effectively monitor social distancing policies, and to understand social disparities and environmental contexts in risk communication. This project will make theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions that advance the understanding of the COVID-19 spread across both time and space. The communication aspects of this research will serve to educate communities about the science, timing, and geography of virus transmission in order to enhance actions for addressing such global health challenges. This project explores the capabilities and potential of integrating social media big data and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) technologies to enable and transform spatial epidemiology research and risk communication. Results will be disseminated broadly to multiple stakeholder groups. Further, this project will support both researchers and students from underrepresented groups, broadening participation in STEM fields. Lastly, the Web platform developed in this project will serve as an education tool for students in geography, communication, mathematics, and public health, as well as for effectively engaging with communities about the science of COVID-19. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past health research mainly focuses on quantitative modeling of human transmission using various epidemic models. How to effectively communicate the science of an epidemic outbreak to the general public remains a challenge. When an epidemic outbreak occurs without specific controls in place, it can be particularly challenging to improve community risk awareness and action. The research team, composed of experts from geography, mathematics, public health and life sciences communication will (1) develop innovative mathematical predictive models that integrate spatio-temporal-social network information and community-centered approaches; (2)  integrate census statistics, human mobility and social media big data, as well as policy controls to conduct data-synthesis-driven and epidemiology-guided risk analysis; And (3) utilize panel surveys and text mining techniques on social media data for better understanding public awareness of COVID-19 and for investigating various instant message and visual image strategies to effectively communicate about risks to the public. The results of this project will lead to a better understanding of the geography and spread of COVID-19. Additionally, it is expected that the methods developed in this project can be applied to mitigate the outbreak risks of future epidemics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project team is composed of experts from geography, mathematics, public health and life sciences communication, conducts research on the understanding of human mobility patterns and geospatial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the COVID-19 pandemic. Below we will primarily report the research objectives, contribution and outcomes of the project.</p> <p>Specifically, this project (1) tracks multiscale human mobility dynamics and changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, identify the heterogeneity of community?s adherence level to public health policies, and understand the impacts to business traffic and people?s daily mobility across different neighborhoods; (2) develops innovative mathematical predictive models that integrate spatio-temporal-social network information and public health policies for simulating the dynamics of the COVID-19 spread; And (3) utilizes panel surveys and text mining techniques on social media data for better understanding public awareness of COVID-19 and for investigating various instant message and visual image strategies to effectively communicate about risks to the public.</p> <p>Several significant products and results include: (1) an interactive web-based mapping platform that provides timely quantitative information on how people in different counties and states in the US reacted to the social distancing guidelines by tracking their mobility patterns over time. (2) an open mobility data repository (https://github.com/GeoDS/COVID19USFlows) that includes daily and weekly dynamic origin-to-destination (O-D) population flows inferred at three geographic scales: census tract, county, and state in the United States, which can support human mobility-based COVID-19 studies. (3) statistically significant association of state-specific rates of COVID-19 confirmed cases with the change rates of median travel distance and median home dwell time of anonymous mobile phone users. The findings suggested that stay-at-home social distancing mandates, when they were followed by measurable mobility changes, were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread. (4) a state-specific projection of COVID-19 infection in the US and evaluation of three major control measures (travel restriction, testing/reporting, and social distancing). We found that the average reporting rate of COVID-19 cases over all states was only about 22% in March 2020. The increased testing/reporting capacity and strict social-distancing (including face masking) and self-quarantine rules are most effective nonpharmaceutical interventions in abating the pandemic. (5) a new human mobility flow-augmented stochastic epidemic modeling framework that is able to distinguish different sub-regions and their corresponding epidemic growth characteristics. (6) Public perception of the risks of digital contact tracing is divided by rural-urbaness and political ideology in the US, and this perception might explain heterogeneity in mobility patterns across counties.&nbsp; (7) Lastly, we found that science communicators from minority groups used innovative communication strategies - integrating entertainment and intersectional identity - to communicate about COVID-19 and other science issues to the public through videos and images.</p> <p>Eight graduate students and four undergraduate students from the STEM majors and under-represented groups such as women in science have been trained throughout this project. More than 10 research articles related to this project have been published in prominent journals (e.g., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) for research outcome dissemination and academic communications. In addition, our team has been engaged with the University of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services for COVID-19 responses. Dr. Gao has been invited by both public and private sectors to share the research findings from this project to inform public health related decision makings. The research outcomes of this project have been reported by multiple news media channels (e.g., CNN Health, Fox, NBC, Wisconsin Public Radio).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/11/2021<br>      Modified by: Song&nbsp;Gao</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2027375/2027375_10661155_1636608780178_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2027375/2027375_10661155_1636608780178_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2027375/2027375_10661155_1636608780178_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The web interface of the mobility tracking portal.</div> <div class="imageCredit">GeoDS Lab@UW-Madison</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Song&nbsp;Gao</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2027375/2027375_10661155_1636608973547_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2027375/2027375_10661155_1636608973547_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2027375/2027375_10661155_1636608973547_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A.
