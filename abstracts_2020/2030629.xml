<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will help COVID-19 patients with a lower burden to the medical system.  This project will lead to a low-cost wearable internet of things (IoT) system to enable improved telemedicine. The collected data can be leveraged for public health purposes. The proposed project will develop telemedicine software tools using real-time physiological data from a wearable that is affordable, comfortable, non-invasive, washable, and reusable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project will develop a risk stratification mechanism for patients who experience signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 such as dry cough, shortness of breath, and a fever. Such type of lower respiratory tract illness could be managed at home without resorting to hospital admission. Our objectives include development of: 1) a multi-modality system for diagnosing illness conditions for COVID-19 and similar contiguous diseases; 2) a software telemedicine interface with algorithms that learn and assess the need for further hospitalization; 3) a pilot study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Just in the U.S. alone there have been over 380,000 cases within one month of the outbreak; even with all the social distancing and shelter in place measures, such a number quickly reached one million within less than 3 months. Such an outbreak has caused major, and in some states overwhelming, load on the healthcare facilities and personnel. Furthermore, patients with pre-existing health conditions, such as those with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), diagnosed with COVID-19 have more than 3 times higher risk of severe symptoms and mortality<a href="file:///C:/Users/leosa/Dropbox/Personal/Lloyd/LASARRUS/NSF/STTR%20Phase%20I%20-%20Efforts%20-%20Telehealth/Final%20Report/NSF-STTR-Phase1-Final-Report_Accomplishments.docx#_ftn3">[3]</a>. Prevention and early recognition of COPD exacerbation is important to reducing severe symptoms through early intervention. The clinical course of COPD is marked by escalating symptoms that lead to an increased rate of hospitalizations<a href="file:///C:/Users/leosa/Dropbox/Personal/Lloyd/LASARRUS/NSF/STTR%20Phase%20I%20-%20Efforts%20-%20Telehealth/Final%20Report/NSF-STTR-Phase1-Final-Report_Accomplishments.docx#_ftn4">[4]</a><a href="file:///C:/Users/leosa/Dropbox/Personal/Lloyd/LASARRUS/NSF/STTR%20Phase%20I%20-%20Efforts%20-%20Telehealth/Final%20Report/NSF-STTR-Phase1-Final-Report_Accomplishments.docx#_ftn5">[5]</a>.
