<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program and SBE's Social Psychology program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Howard C. Stevenson at the University of Pennsylvania this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the racial stress and coping processes associated with discriminatory school discipline. Since 1975, research has demonstrated racial disparities in school discipline disproportionately impacting Black youth (Child Defense Fund, 1975). Black students receive more disciplinary referrals, harsher consequences, and more punitive interventions compared to their peers, even when cited for the same or similar infractions (Brown &amp; Tillio, 2013; Skiba, Arrendondo, &amp; Rausch, 2014). Black youth are not only aware of these racial disparities in discipline, but also associate differential treatment with greater perceptions of inequity and discrimination (Bottiani et al., 2016; Hope, Skoog, &amp; Jagers, 2015; Fisher, Wallace, Fenton, 2000). Research demonstrates clear associations between racially disproportionate discipline and negative academic, social, and economic outcomes for Black students, as well as the academic and psychological costs of racial discrimination. However, the specific effects of discriminatory school discipline on Black youth adjustment and relations with racial stress are not well-known. Racial stress is the result of repeated, prolonged exposure to discriminatory environments and interactions, negatively impacting Black youth’s mental, physical, and emotional health (Carter &amp; Helms, 2009; Harrell, 2000; Smith, Yosso, &amp; Solorzano, 2007; Sue, Capodilupo, &amp; Holder, 2008). Schools become sites of racial stress when students routinely experience discriminatory school policies, practices, and interactions with educators. A growing body of research explores the role of families in supporting racial stress coping among Black youth in response to discriminatory events (Anderson &amp; Stevenson, 2018; Anderson, Jones, McKenny, Anyiwo, Gaylord-Harding, 2018). However, there is limited research examining school-based racial stress and coping in relation to discriminatory discipline, and the role educators can play in reducing racial stress within discriminatory discipline interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the project entitled, Transforming Discriminatory Discipline through Addressing Racial Stress: A Mixed-Methods Investigation, is to examine two critical, timely, and relevant topics- racially disproportionate discipline and racial stress/trauma. The research project employs a mixed-method approach across two phases intending (1) to qualitatively explore teachers’ and students’ understanding and experiences regarding racial stress and discipline, and (2) to develop a culturally competent transformative discipline intervention for educators to address school-based racial stress and reduce discriminatory discipline interactions. Phase 1 involves a qualitative exploration of educators’ beliefs and practices regarding discipline and racial stress, as well as mixed-method inquiry of Black students’ experiences and coping processes regarding discriminatory discipline and racial stress. Phase 2 involves a pilot intervention, informed by data collected in Phase 1, that addresses racially stressful disciplinary interactions by testing aspects of the Racial Encounter Coping Appraisal and Socialization Theory (RECAST) model (Anderson &amp; Stevenson, 2018) and provides educators with opportunities to gain in-the-moment trauma-informed discipline techniques. The proposed study intends to advance scientific knowledge of Black youth racial stress, coping, and adjustment, to improve educator-student relationships, reduce racial disparities in school discipline, and to enhance the educational and professional experiences of both Black youth and their educators, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Polk completed her research fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate school of Education, mentored by Dr. Howard Stevenson. Trained as a human development researcher and mental health clinician, she explores the role of educational and social contexts in shaping and being shaped by adolescent developmental processes and examines the interpersonal and institutional effects of marginalization on the academic and psychosocial development of racially diverse youth.

The objective of her research program was to explore these processes and develop culturally relevant school discipline interventions that decrease discipline disparities, improve student-teacher relationships, and enhance school climates. An overview of the research project outcomes and findings that contribute to the intellectual merit and broader impacts of Polk’s work are described below.      Overview &amp; Intellectual Merit  In the last decade, researchers at the forefront of racially disproportionate school discipline have advocated for race-conscious approaches to eliminate racial discipline gaps (Carter et al., 2017). In countless studies addressing how racial disparities in school discipline impact youth achievement, mental health, school-based relationships, perceptions of school-based equity, and involvement with juvenile justice, authors have recommended race and culturally-conscious approaches to school discipline where race-neutral or universal interventions have failed. "Transforming Discriminatory Discipline through Addressing Racial Stress: A Mixed-Methods Investigation," or the Transforming Discipline Project, adopted a multi-phase, mixed-methods approach to understanding the policies, practices, and educator-student interactions that contribute to racial disparities in discipline, and to develop culturally sustaining, racial literacy interventions that transform school discipline. Moreover, the Transforming Discipline Project intended to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of race-conscious discipline interventions with educators by exploring relations between school discipline and racial stress during discipline interactions.   In a forthcoming narrative systematic review, Polk et al. (in prep) summarized extant literature on race-conscious school discipline interventions and their effect on racial disparities in high school discipline. Following PRISMA guidelines, an abstract and full-text review of the literature resulted in nine studies with only seven studies meeting the authors’ inclusion and exclusion criteria. While interventions varied across targeted problems (e.g., perception of discipline climate, suspensions) and intervention population (e.g., student, teacher),  preliminary findings from this review marginally support the use of race-conscious approaches to address racial gaps in discipline. However, the limited number of studies examining the impact of race-conscious interventions highlights the need for further testing of race-conscious interventions and research addressing additional factors contributing to the racial discipline gap.   In a forthcoming qualitative study, Polk et al. (in prep) use the Racial Encounter Coping Appraisal and Socialization Theory (RECAST; Anderson &amp; Stevenson, 2019) as a framework to explore educator perspectives on school discipline and racial stress. In focus groups with twenty-two educators teaching in public and private high school settings, the authors examine educators’ racial stress experiences and coping processes during disciplinary moments (Vavrus &amp; Cole, 2002) with Black youth. Key findings suggest that educators’ perceptions of the purpose of discipline and their experiences/awareness of racial stress inform their disciplinary approaches. Moreover, many educators feel unprepared to address or cope with racial stress during discipline interactions. Findings from this study highlight potential areas for intervention to ensure equitable school discipline interactions, policies, and practices.    A third pilot study examines the impact of a race-conscious school discipline intervention with educators to enhance educators' racial stress coping skills and reduce discriminatory discipline interactions with youth. The implementation of this intervention and analysis of pre, post, and follow-up tests with participants is ongoing, and findings will inform theory and extend the literature on race-conscious approaches to reducing racial discipline disparities.      Broader Impact  During the course of this postdoctoral fellowship, Polk established strong research-practice partnerships with public and private schools, conducted focus groups, and administered surveys to students and educators exploring their perceptions of racially disproportionate discipline, racial stress, and coping processes. Findings from the first phase of this work have been disseminated through conference presentations, lectures, education association workshops, and forthcoming manuscripts. The associated pilot intervention contributes to both practice and research that supports diverse students, educators, and communities. Further, this research program was committed to training and supporting burgeoning researchers and practitioners from underrepresented groups and offered mentorship to graduate students from diverse backgrounds.
