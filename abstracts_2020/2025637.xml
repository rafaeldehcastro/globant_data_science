<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences. As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. While the goal of models in the language sciences is to provide universal explanations, the bulk of research is still conducted on English and other majority languages. Moreover, research in the language sciences -- despite growing awareness of the need for diversity -- is largely carried out by practitioners from majority language communities. This is problematic for two distinct reasons: findings are not representative of the increasingly diverse US population and neither are researchers, clinicians and educators.  This 29-week Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program addresses these two issues by equipping 14 undergraduate students per year from under-represented communities with the skills and knowledge required to become successful in graduate programs focused on speech, language and communication sciences and in working with members of linguistic minorities. The program will include six key modules: (i) Establishment of a community of scholars through active participation in academic seminars, (ii) Mentored Scientific research, (iii) Research Ethics training, (iv) Research dissemination, (v) Participation in workshops to prepare a graduate school application portfolio, (vi) Organization of a translational conference for students, professionals and community leaders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruiting students who use lesser-studied languages, spoken and signed, and non-mainstream varieties of English, and having them conduct research with Mentoring Faculty who are experts in the various fields related to language sciences (Theoretical Linguistics, First and Second Language Acquisition and Processing, Bilingualism, Speech, Language and Communication Sciences, Developmental and Acquired Disorders) applied to lesser studied varieties of English and other languages, constitutes an important step toward redressing the imbalance and ensuring that the field will benefit from the scholarly study of the linguistic and cultural diversity found in New York City. The program will benefit from both the tremendous ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of Brooklyn and Queens, in the recruitment of student participants as well as project participants, and the nine mentors' state-of-the-art research facilities that include university-based laboratories such as Long Island University Downtown Brooklyn Speech-Language-Hearing Clinic, Brooklyn College Linguistics Laboratory, the City University of New York Graduate Center Developmental Neurolinguistics Laboratory as well as off-campus sites including the Endangered Language Alliance, Haskins Laboratory and YVY Research Institute located in a Head Start program that serves 3,000 children speaking 15 distinct languages.  This REU program thus serves two purposes: to involve undergraduates in research projects that can be expected to contribute publishable results and novel data sets that will be made available to the field through open-access websites, while simultaneously encouraging and preparing minority students to undertake graduate work on diverse languages and cultures. Overall, this REU site will prepare students to become accomplished researchers and practitioners in the Speech-Language-Communication Sciences equipped with the knowledge and skills to work with minority languages and cultures.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF-REU site program ‘Intersection of Linguistics, Language and Culture’ (ILLC) has contributed novel results, data and research strategies that have emerged from the undergraduate participants research projects on diverse ethnic groups, cultures and languages.  More specifically fellow projects have contributed new methodologies to the field (e.g., matched guise technique adapted to preschoolers, development of new tests to collect data on children’s language production, use of Modified Sinewave speech to trigger a "missing fundamental frequency" effect in speech perception), new findings on the structures of understudied and/or endangered languages (e.g., American Sign Language, Hawaiian Creole, Mixteco, Yiddish); on the long-term effects of maternal depression on young children’s language skills;  on children’s acquisition of different languages and language varieties (African American English, Hebrew, Russian, Dominican Spanish);  adult language use (Arabic, Haitian Creole, Yiddish); phonetic and acoustic properties that characterize specific languages (e.g., Cantonese) and that enable distinction between male and female voices; speech perception and lexical processing in Spanish-speaking bilinguals; on the effects of specific types of intervention on the language production of brain-damaged patients; on the relation between age-related hearing impairment, cognitive decline and bilingualism; on the use of gestures in relation to speech production.  These novel research paradigms and findings have been disseminated in the context of more than 70 regional, national and international student (Temple University Language, Linguistics and Life Conference; Hunter College Linguistics and Language Studies Conference; Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM),  professional (e.g. American Speech-Language and Hearing Association) and academic (American Acoustic Society; Neurobiology of Language; North East Linguistic Society; Linguistic Society of America; Germanic Linguistics) conferences and on the program website that has received more than 20,000 visits.  The results of the projects exhibit intellectual merits in that they enable the testing of hypotheses and models in linguistic theory, speech-language-communication sciences, cognitive and language processing on a broader range of (understudied) languages and cultures than available until now.  The findings are relevant to fields as diverse as education (both assessments and teaching practices), speech technology and clinical practice (including audiology and speech-language-pathology).  Two other major strengths of the first cycle of the ILLC program have been, first, the success in enrolling two cohorts totaling 28 students with a majority of members from underrepresented minorities in higher education &mdash; with American Indian, Black, Hispanic, Mixed and Multi-Race students making up 50% of the participants( and White students only 30%)- and that have included 43% of first generation students. The second great strength of the first cycle was in the implementation of the ‘Reciprocal Empowerment’ philosophy that has positively contributed to the program participants’ feeling of belonging to the broader scholarly community and in succeeding in entering graduate program (including competitive masters programs in Computational Linguistics, Communication Science and Disorders and English and prestigious doctoral programs in Audiology, Linguistics and Cognitive Science) and, simultaneously, to the expansion of the mentors’ research agendas.  In reaching both its research and mentoring objectives, the NSF-REU Site ILLC program has succeeded in   fostering research conducted on and by members of minorities  and in  showing students who are heritage speakers of non-English languages&mdash;or native speakers of socially under-valued English dialects&mdash;how to expand and exploit these valuable resources to help construct their careers.
