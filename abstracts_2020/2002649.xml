<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[In this era of pervasive multicore machines, GPUs, cloud services, big data, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, there is a critical need for an institute to create a sustainable, discipline-wide ecosystem for incorporating parallel and distributed computing (PDC) into undergraduate computing curricula. Such an institute would support the community of educators, students, and other stakeholders, with the goal of developing a workforce that is ready to meet the challenges of working with current and future computing fabrics. The investigators propose planning for such an institute (iPDC) that can help eliminate the longstanding barrier of the sequential computing paradigm such that, analogous to the establishment of the object oriented paradigm, the PDC paradigm is naturally integrated into Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CE) curricula across various institutions as recommended by the 2013 ACM/IEEE Computer Science Curricula and now by ABET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the network of funded and unfunded collaborators, established contacts with instructors at institutions serving underrepresented groups, and outreach efforts, the project will robustly engage with stakeholder communities through four well-structured planning workshops, weekly teleconferences, and feedback and dissemination activities to formulate the key attributes of the institute.Broadening PDC education will further enable advances in science and engineering, which depend increasingly on PDC systems, by providing the next generation of practitioners and researchers with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively exploit them. The curriculum standards, adoption, and dissemination activities will have synergistic international components. Overall, this project will facilitate a rich exchange of ideas within the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The breadth and complexity of the task and the scale of its impact justify the need for an institute-level investment to bring computing curricula into the 21st century.   The Problem: Modern computing systems pervasively employ PDC, which new computer science and engineering, and related computing disciplines, are not prepared to work with, according to multiple stakeholder groups (national labs and agencies, including DoD and DOE, and industry). Recent graduates do not understand the modern software development ecosystem, which relies on parallelism, distribution, asynchrony, scaling, integration across disparate libraries and data sources, data-driven intelligence, test-driven design, and pervasive concerns for security. This lack of preparation causes a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other countries that address the problem (including China, India, and Russia). Affected areas include national security (cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, cyber warfare, defense systems), research and development (high performance computing, data science, AI, and in critical applications such as pharmaceuticals, advanced materials, climate forecasting, and chip design), and the economy (high onboarding cost of graduates, computing infrastructure, energy systems, e-commerce, and healthcare). Methods: This project gathered input from a diverse set of stakeholders to guide a vision for a large-scale effort to comprehensively work with the identified actors, factors, and strategies to achieve transformative change. The gathering happened through three stakeholder input workshops (Nov?21@SC, Mar?20@SIGCSE, and Jul?20) and a fourth institute design workshop (Mar?21), each supported by thirty to fifty stakeholders.  A final reporting-out workshop to NSF and other federal agencies was held in Fall 2021 in Alexandria, VA.   The first workshop, which focused on PDC practitioners, identified important factors inhibiting introduction of PDC in the curriculum, strategies to address these factors, and actors for implementing them. The second workshop primarily interfaced with educators, identifying more specific factors and actors in that ecosystem. The third workshop focused on leaders across the industry, labs, and academia, and their synergy with academia. The fourth workshop examined the lessons learnt from the previous workshops, and considered the design of the institute itself, its mission, strategies, and activities. We organized our final reporting-out workshop in a hybrid mode to ensure attendance by as many program directors from NSF and other agencies as possible.  Solution: The model of computation used to introduce students to the concepts and approaches of computational problem solving needs to be updated to reflect modern PDC systems, tools, methods, algorithms, use cases, datasets, and threats. It will take a significant investment to overcome inertia in the education system and to change expectations of employers and accreditation boards.
