<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award provides funding for two small regional conferences that will continue to rotate among the three host institutions: Iowa State University, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Wisconsin. These conferences promote a broad view of commutative algebra, inspiring conversations, and collaborations between different areas of algebra. This is a continuation of a conference series, with two meetings each at Minnesota and Wisconsin between 2015 and 2017. After a brief hiatus, Iowa State University will join the rotation, hosting the conference in 2020 before the event returns to Minnesota in 2021. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Commutative algebra  is filled with connections to other areas, including: algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, combinatorics, number theory, applied algebra, representation theory, computational algebra, and more.  The conference series supported by this award promotes a broad view of commutative algebra, helping connect it with the research environments in the mathematics departments involved.&lt;br/&gt;Information about the conference will be found at http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~cberkesc/CA/CA.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant, and associated grant awarded to the University of Minnesota, ultimately funded 3 regional conferences in commutative algebra from 2021-2023.  The originally planned meetings were canceled at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.  We have since held meetings as circumstances and health guidelines allowed with meetings in Minneapolis in 2021 and 2023 and one meeting in Ames in 2022.  Each meeting was held over one or two days, featured 5 to 7 invited hour-long addresses from experts in the field, short turbo talks by graduate student participants, and professional development discussions over lunch.  The 2021 meeting in Minneapolis was limited to driving participants only and featured talks by Patricia Klein, Monica Lewis, Matthew Mastroeni, Vic Reiner, and Botong Wong.  The 2022 meeting in Ames had up to 60 participants over 2 days and featured talks by Juliette Bruce, Eloisa Grifo, Jack Jeffries, Aida Maraj, Thomas Polstra, Connor Simpson, and Ola Sobieska.  The smaller 2023 meeting in Minneapolis featured talks by Amy Huang, Janet Page, Michael Perlman, Mahrud Sayrafi, and Mark Walker over one day.  Feedback solicited from conference participants was very positive and helped improve future meetings.  For instance, after the second meeting it was suggested the graduate student turbo talks could be done before the group lunch so that students and experts could discuss the projects in more depth.  We also strived to create a welcoming and diverse meeting; roughly 40% of meeting participants identified as female.
