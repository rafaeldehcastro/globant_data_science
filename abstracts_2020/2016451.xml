<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award will support attendance and training of early career U.S. researchers at the 20th conference on Ciliate Molecular Biology, which will be held at the Lisbon School of Health Technology campus in Lisbon, Portugal, on July 14-18 of 2020. Ciliates are unique organisms, the study of which has yielded multiple transformational discoveries that have significantly advanced the molecular biology field.   This biannual meeting is the major convocation of experimental biologists working with ciliates and plays a critical role in sustaining the vitality of this important research community. The 2020 meeting will consist of ten platform sessions and two poster sessions for scientific exchange.  The Broader Impacts of this conference are several, including opportunities for professional development of early career researchers and efforts to facilitate the integration of ciliate research and teaching.  Platform sessions and a workshop will facilitate the  sharing and implementation of ciliate-based teaching modules for both undergraduate and high school students.  Additional Broader Impacts include training young scientists at oral platform presentations, as well as broadening participation of groups underrepresented in science, especially women.  Possibilities for collaborations will be promoted by fostering scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on ciliates has led to key discoveries and established new biological paradigms such as self-splicing RNAs, telomeres and telomerase, the role of histone modifications in gene expression, and the dynein motor protein. More recent studies have provided novel insights into the role of RNA interference-related pathways and non-coding RNAs in the epigenetic regulation of the programmed chromosome rearrangements, and the function of post-translational tubulin modification. Ciliated protozoa possess an unusual biology that encompasses the presence of two functionally distinct nuclei in each cell, a complex cytoskeleton, abundant chromosomes and cilia.  The innovative research approaches afforded by ciliates provide investigators with unique opportunities to gain mechanistic understanding of major biological processes that are expected to inform the wider molecular biology community.  The objectives of this conference are to exchange scientific findings, support and mentor early career scientists, encourage interdisciplinary research, integrate research and education, promote technical innovations, and develop resources for the ciliate research community.   Platform sessions will disseminate the latest discoveries of molecular function encompassing studies of diverse cellular processes. A session on genome evolution will demonstrate the value of intensive computational approaches to gain insights into the selective forces that have shaped these organisms. Another new session will focus on development of new tools and resources for ciliate research. These broad goals will highlight important future directions for ciliate research and STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
