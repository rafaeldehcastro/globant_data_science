<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Food insecurity is the lack of consistent and reliable access to nutritious food needed for an active, healthy life. It is a significant problem in Harris County, Texas, where over 14% of households and 23% of children were food insecure at the beginning of 2020. This problem has been further magnified during recent devastating events, including Hurricane Harvey and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It is unclear how the nutritional needs of Houston's vulnerable populations will be addressed amidst multiple disasters, including hurricanes and flooding, COVID-19, economic disruptions, and systemic food insecurity. The Houston Food Bank (HFB) serves the Greater Houston area and collaborates with over 1,500 partners to address families' needs experiencing food insecurity. Disaster preparation and response decisions have been mainly based on incomplete data, human intuition, and pro-bono input from consulting firms. The COVID-19 pandemic has further induced stresses on the organization’s funding and personnel. While the HFB has absorbed and adapted to flooding events and other disasters in the past, it envisions organizational transformation to engage in resilience-building strategies that go beyond current practice. Thus, there is an urgent and critical need for HFB and other such regional food banks to develop and utilize decision support systems that intelligently aid in disaster preparation, response, and performance measurement. Unaddressed, emergency food security supply chains are unlikely to ensure efficient, equitable, and effective distribution of food and related resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project’s goal is to improve the resilience of nonprofit food banks’ supply chains by developing and deploying methods and technology systems that enable food banks to fully prepare for disasters, respond to the needs of the communities impacted, and evaluate their performance during disasters. This planning grant involves the preparation of a detailed plan for the deployment of a research-centered socio-technical project to develop and implement decision-making tools that will facilitate integrated disaster planning between HFB and nonprofit agencies involved in food distribution. The specific objectives are to (1) Design organizational resilience indicators and mapping of food equity needs using different census data at low levels of aggregation (e.g., the CDC Social Vulnerability Index) and HFB’s client network,  (2) Design a multilayer, complex network for HFB, consisting of interdependencies both upstream and downstream, (3) Design decision-making tools for disaster management using computational game theory and deep reinforcement learning, and (4) Design the collection of same-day privacy-preserving data from underserved and vulnerable populations over a potentially disrupted communication infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>To understand the complexity of planning equitable and efficient food distribution, six workshops (<strong>W1-W6</strong>) were held with our civic partner HFB and its partners, designed to build on common motivations and reflect on the complexities of the identified problems and issues to overcome (we only summarize the challenges related to this Stage 2 proposal). The overall goal was a <strong>co-creation process </strong>to inspire collective action, wherein innovative ideas are generated in thoughtful, open, and productive conversation. <strong>W1-<em>Kickoff </em></strong>involved all community-partner stakeholders, introduced the project and sought to obtain stakeholder buy-in and commitment. <strong>W2-<em>Organizational resilience </em></strong>highlighted COVID-19 as a slow disaster that has impacted how HFB sources food, collaborates with partners, collects data, and transports food to people and people to food. Discussions focused on the compounding effects of slow-onset and rapid-onset disasters, changes in demand and supply, HFB's operational response to the complexity of the problem, and HFB's need to act like a learning organization. A key challenge identified was<em> a lack of communication and coordinated planning. </em><strong>W3-<em>Decision-making tools for slow-onset disasters </em></strong>focused on the<strong><em> </em></strong>mismatch between expectations and outcomes and the lack of knowledge by distribution partners on what will be delivered by HFB. A key challenge identified was<em> the lack of a food distribution ecosystem </em>and considering the needs of the HFB partners for communication, data/information, and decision-making tools. <strong>W4-<em>Decision-making tools for rapid-onset disasters</em></strong><em> </em>highlighted how HFB and its partners rely on critical information about the state of infrastructure operations (e.g., transportation, electricity) to make decisions to prepare for, respond to, and recover from rapid-onset disasters. Participants especially noted three challenges: (i) operating without the knowledge of how a disaster will unfold; (ii) mining data from multiple sources; and (iii) understanding the "big picture" of disaster impacts as opposed to going over individual reports of road closures and power outages. A key challenge identified was<em> the lack of knowledge of infrastructure vulnerabilities.</em> <strong>W5-<em>Data collection and privacy</em></strong> established that while HFB and its partners have strong, established collaborations and mutual trust, there is room for improvements in data collection and sharing, specifically around (i) transparency in data requirements (i.e., partners do not always know why certain data is collected and how it is utilized); (ii) advanced information on supplies (i.e., partners have limited information about what items HFB will send in the near future); (iii) sharing personal information (i.e., some individuals served by HFB partners are concerned about sharing personal information with HFB and partners); and (iv) information about food preparation (i.e., information is needed on how individuals served by HFB prepare their food, which could help determine what food items can be distributed). A key challenge identified was<em> a lack of communication and coordinated planning. </em>Finally, <strong>W6-<em>Equity</em></strong><em> </em>established that during the COVID-19 pandemic, HFB has relied on mass food distribution sites (e.g., drive-thru distribution in stadium parking lots), which do not address food distribution inequities related to transportation challenges/reaching the locations. With massive increases in need, there was no time to be methodical about distributing food <em>equitably</em>. An additional challenge is that local distribution partners (e.g., pantries) may close during disasters, limiting reach in communities.
