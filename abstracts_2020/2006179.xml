<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The success of all students in science has become a priority, as the economic future depends on a workforce that is capable in science, mathematics, technology, and engineering. One area of emphasis has been on elementary science, where childrenâ€™s early attitudes and orientations about science are formed.  Given the growth of high-quality evaluations of elementary science programs in recent years and the need to know what works in science education, an up-to-date review identifying effective programs and malleable factors in elementary science is needed.  The goal of this project is to conduct a meta-analysis to assist in establishing a solid base of evidence to inform further research, practice, and policy in the area of early science education.  The previous meta-analysis completed by this team published findings from approximately ten years ago.  This project will bring up-to-date the meta-analysis literature in the area of early science education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The review methods in the proposed quantitative synthesis on elementary science programs will be similar to those used by the What Works Clearinghouse.  The focus of the review procedures is on timeliness, comprehensiveness, transparency, and minimizing bias. The goal of the project is to obtain and synthesize the entire literature evaluating elementary science programs to discover what works, for whom, and under what conditions. The team will systematically review the literature available in English between 2010 and 2021 to locate every study that meets well-established and accepted standards. Second, studies are grouped by categories, to look for patterns among effect sizes across studies. The team will use meta-regression techniques to test statistical significance of the categories and will explore cross-cutting substantive and methodological factors, as well as key moderators and mediators.  The team will communicate findings to many audiences, including scholarly journals, practitioner journals, and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by pre-K-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main purpose of the project was to carry out a comprehensive meta-analysis of studies evaluating science programs in elementary schools. The synthesis project used a best-evidence approach, incorporating the highest quality studies that are available in the literature. The review methods incorporated modern standards. The distinctive focus of the review procedures was on timeliness, comprehensiveness, transparency, and minimizing bias. Our goal was to obtain and synthesize the entire literature evaluating elementary science programs to discover what works, for whom, and under what conditions.  We did conduct the meta-analysis and dissemination efforts are underway. What we have found is that there are limited high-quality studies available.  These studies are of a diverse set of programs and approaches, common approaches included teacher professional development focused on inquiry methods, sometimes with accompanying curricula, and well as approaches integrating science with language and literacy.  There were also examples use of virtual laboratories and simulations as well a computer-assisted strategy to address misconceptions.  There were specific programs developed with English Learners in mind.  While some of the particular models were found to be effective, due to the low number of studies, we cannot say if particular approaches were effective overall.  We were able to describe the state of evidence as limited, and discuss trends we saw in the types of programs being evaluated.   There are specific models that have demonstrated effectiveness.  This illustrates what is known about evidence-based approaches to elementary science achievement and highlight the gaps in the literature.
