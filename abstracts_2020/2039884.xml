<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will contribute data and an analytical synthesis to the Arctic Councilâ€™s (AC) Pan-Arctic Report on Gender and Diversity in the Arctic. Advancing gender equality through empowerment is a key component of sustainable global development. Empowerment is the capacity of individuals and groups to exercise control over their social, economic, and political circumstances. Empowerment enables people to achieve objectives and maximize the quality of their lives and those of their families and communities. This project will collect, analyze, and synthesize data on the current state and emerging trends in gender equality and empowerment across the Arctic. The full Arctic Council report will include policy-relevant conclusions and be broadly disseminated among Arctic stakeholders, policy makers, and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will employ an inclusive, collaborative approach to collect and analyze datasets, documents, and case studies to understand to what extent political, economic, and civic empowerment is distributed by gender. Activities include the integration of data from diverse sources, including existing demographic, income, and employment statistics, legal and government documents, and Indigenous scholars and stakeholders. Broader impacts of the work include recommendations for the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls, raising public awareness of gender issues in the Arctic, and the development of a publicly available data compendium on gender empowerment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UGEEA project produced an integrated, transdisciplinary synthesis of knowledge about gender equality and empowerment in the Arctic, with the main product delivered in the form of the contribution to the Report on Gender Equality in the Arctic (Phase III) under the auspices of the Arctic Council's Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) (https://arcticgenderequality.network/phase-3/pan-arctic-report).  The research project implemented a transdisciplinary, inclusive, and collaborative approach by collecting and assimilating diverse data and information flows from a diverse group of contributing experts, including academics from the Arctic states, Indigenous scholars and knowledge-holders, local youth, and public officials.   The project developed a conceptual framework for analyzing gender equality and empowerment across the Arctic at multiple scales with a special focus on regional and local (community) levels, including rural, predominantly Indigenous communities. The UGEEA created a system of key variables to provide a basic framework for analyzing gender empowerment in the Arctic across key areas?political/public administration, economic, and civic.

It also corresponds to the collective gender division of labor in resource-based economies and reflects remaining stereotypes about gender roles in traditional gender domains.   Based on the evaluation of research results, the UGEEA provided the following major policy-relevant highlights: (1) all genders' empowerment ? opportunities for equal and meaningful participation in decision-making and responsibility sharing in all spheres at all levels ? is key to community sustainability, resilience, and thrivability; (2) moving gender empowerment from the periphery to the center of public policy discourse and decision making is vital to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (particularly, Goal 5) in the Arctic; (3) culturally, politically, and economically diverse Arctic regions require different approaches to improve gender empowerment and overcome gender inequality and inequity.

Broader impact:  The results of this research may be relevant to scholars interested in gender studies and decision-makers at the various entities of government ? national, regional, and local government agencies, including Tribal governments and institutions in the Arctic ? in order to achieve a broader impact on mainstreaming gender into different wider policies and programs in the Arctic and beyond.  The key findings from this research project were incorporated into the Gender Equality in the Arctic report that was acknowledged and included in the Reykjavik Declaration 2021 at the Twelfth Ministerial Meeting of the Arctic Council (May 20, 2021). The Declaration emphasized "the importance of gender equality and respect for diversity for sustainable development in the Arctic and welcomed the Pan-Arctic Report, Gender Equality in the Arctic, Phase 3, encouraged the mainstreaming of gender-based analysis in the work of the Arctic Council and called for further action to advance gender equality in the Arctic" (Reykjavik Declaration 2021).  Gender perspective was also integrated into the new Strategic Plan of the Arctic Council, marking an important milestone as equality is considered a prerequisite of sustainable development in the future Arctic.  The project produced publications and organized special sessions and conference presentations to disseminate findings and outline policy-relevant highlights, developed the E-Library with literature related to gender empowerment in the Arctic, integrated research findings in the academic course Arctic Affairs for the GWU students, and contributed to the Audio-Visual Exhibition Arctic Women's Voices: Standing Strong in the Face of COVID-19 to inform academics, decision-makers, stakeholders, and the general public.
