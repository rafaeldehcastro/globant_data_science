<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative:  National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center).  The focus of a spectrum research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum. The PIs bring together an interdisciplinary team to explore a research case study on the coexistence between cellular systems and weather satellites via three interconnected research themes related to fundamentals and emerging technologies, experimentation, and policy. The prime collaborators include Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech.), Rutgers University, University of Southern California, and University of Colorado, Denver. The outcomes of the proposed work will help improving understanding of spectrum co-existence among passive and active systems. The proposed engagement and partnership workshops will bring together spectrum stakeholders from various sectors, disciplines, and domains, thus taking a step forward towards breaking the barriers between silos. Involvement of non-traditional stakeholders such as observatories, non-profits, and startups are proposed which will help broaden the participation. The planning activities proposed will lead to a better understanding of the challenges and gaps in spectrum research and education encountered by academia, industry, national labs, and other stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund activities towards the development of a full center proposal. The PIs propose a reductionist parametric model that will quantify adjacent channel interference (ACI) to weather satellites due to 5G transmissions. They also propose to conduct an in-depth, integrative experimental study of ACI which has the potentials to provide new insights into the spatio-spectral spreading of energy from 5G. A rigorous exploration and definition of spectrum attributes within the context of the considered case study is proposed along with a new game-theoretic framework for assessing the technical, economic, and social impacts of policy making in the spectrum world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
