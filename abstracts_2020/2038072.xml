<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Our understanding of how floodplains and river channels respond to dam removal mostly comes from coordinated removal where the process is slow and predictable rather than from catastrophic dam breaks. Studies of coordinated removal are limited, and virtually no data exist on river response to dam failure. These are knowledge gaps are of practical significance because many dams in the United States are aging and at risk of failure. The work will advance understanding of the impacts of large floods and an aging infrastructure in the United States, which presents an increasing hazard to communities built downstream of dams. Such understanding is necessary for quantifying risk to best inform stakeholders. The work will also provide valuable research experience for two graduate students, one from an underrepresented group in geosciences. Finally, the team will disseminate the results of the work at conferences, in manuscripts, and openly host the data on Open Topography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the ability to gather high resolution topographic data using an UAV lidar to characterize the aftermath of dam failure on the river and floodplain and how the river responds in the next year. The lidar data generated by this project will provide an important baseline dataset for models aimed at predicting river response to dam failure. The work will advance understanding of the impacts of large floods and an aging infrastructure in the United States, which presents an increasing hazard to communities built downstream of dams. The results will be presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The already historic event caused a failure of the 9-meter Edenville Dam (Wixom Lake). The flood waters from this event traveled ~16 km downstream and caused the 7-meter Sanford Dam (Sanford Lake) to fail, leading to county estimates of $175 million in private property damage and an additional $34 million in public property damage. In addition, the cascade of these catastrophic floods caused intense scour and deposition along the Titabwasse River (Figure 1).

The lidar sensor is a Riegl miniVUX, which performs 100 scans (mirror rotations) per second with a measurement rate up to 100,000 points per second.

This sequence of events offers a unique opportunity to study the geomorphic response to catastrophic dam failure and the cascading hazards posed by climate change and aging infrastructure.    Main approach  We deployed a state-of-the-art drone equipped with lidar (LIght Detection And Ranging) to measure the changes in the surface of the earth due to this event. Our integrated UAV and lidar system is capable of creating high-resolution maps of the Earth?s surface elevation (~10 to 50 n cm).

We flew the drone 3 times (June 2020, August 2020, March 2021) over the course of the year to quantify both the magnitude of the event and the continued evolution of the river system, which was severely disrupted by the intense scour and deposition associated with the dam failures. We focused on the river reaches immediately downstream of each dam failure as well as a longer reach downstream of the Edenville site where intense scour stripped an agricultural field of all its topsoil.     Main Findings Immediately following dam break, there was 1-3 m of incision downstream of Edenville Dam and the creation of a new channel on an ancient terrace with multiple knickpoints ranging in height from 2 to 4 m (Figure 1). At this location, we estimate a peak fluid shear stress of 100 Pa and flow velocity of 5 m/s calculated with HEC-RAS 2D. Peak shear stress rapidly declined downstream of the break, but was still large enough to erode topsoil and cause channel widening. Along the western bank of the river there was intense scouring of farm fields and locally the peak shear stress was 20-40 Pa. Based on our topographic surveys, we estimate the erosional volume of actively cultivated topsoil in this area to be 8,500 m3 (Figure 2). Downstream of the dam break the river experienced spatially variable bank erosion (5 to 15 m). This erosional volume was transported downstream and some of it was deposited along the channel. We calculated 5,495 m3 added to the channel?s banks and bars.  At the Sandford Dam site there was also intense scouring of 1 - 3 m and knickpoint formation, along with 4-10 m of bank erosion. Significant sand deposition occurred on the city park downstream of the dam (Figure 3).    In the 3 months following the dam break, land surface change slowed down dramatically because of the relatively stable knickpoints. The knickpoints at Edenville prevented the complete draining of the Western arm of Wixom Lake. The knickpoint positions at both sites showed upstream movement of 40 m in 2.5 months. Downstream of the Edenville Dam, the channel continued to adjust.        Typical rates of erosion in continental landscapes are on the order of 1-10 centimeters every thousand years, thus this anthropogenically enhanced erosion event accomplished tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years of erosional work, which is well beyond what is expected for the 500-year rainfall event that generated the dam failure. Thus the aging United States Dam infrastructure may amplify fluvial responses to future climate change.                Last Modified: 11/02/2021       Submitted by: Brian J Yanites]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
