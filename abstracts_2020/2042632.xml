<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a drug delivery system for use in joint replacement surgery and in trauma applications, spine infections, and ankle and shoulder replacements. Joint replacements are successful but occasionally complicated by postoperative infections, as are other orthopaedic procedures.  The proposed technology will deliver antibiotics to those surgical sites to reduce infections. The technology will allow antibiotic concentrations to be maintained at higher levels for longer periods of time, which may shorten treatment durations currently leaving patients without a hip or knee for months at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a drug delivery system to treat post-operative joint infections (PJI) for conditions including joint arthroplasties/ The current treatment algorithm for the treatment of postoperative joint infections requires intravenous antibiotics along with surgery to debride the area and deliver antimicrobials locally. Traditionally, this includes the delivery of antimicrobials through the use of bone cement, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Antimicrobials delivered in this fashion reach minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC); however, the primary culprit causing persistent PJI is often bacterial biofilm. The ability to adequately treat and eradicate biofilm-related infections requires an antibiotic concentration known as the minimum bacterial eradication concentration (MBEC), which is 100-1000 times greater in concentration than the MIC. Current drug delivery is limited to a burst elution pattern, with limited duration at the MIC and cannot be modified once surgery is complete. The proposed technology seeks to improve drug delivery to allow higher levels of local delivery that may be increased or changed as culture results warrant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our team successfully completed the NSF I-Corp program through the Boston-MIT Node.  Our experience was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we were able to adapt and overcome to facilitate a tremendously rewarding and education experience.  Through this process we were educated on the processes and steps to evaluate the commercial potential of intellectual property through the customer discovery process. Because of this we completed 100 interviews interviewing experts in orthopaedic surgery, infectious disease doctors, medical device representatives, executives of multiple health related companies, members of a value analysis teams and were even able to interview six patients.  Through this process we learned that there is a critical need for new and innovative idea to treat infections that can occur after a hip or knee replacement.  However, to bring these concepts to market where they can benefit patients, health care providers and the heath care system at large multiple steps must be achieved.  This program allowed us to identify these aspects and has facilitated the development of relationships in industry and within the business community.  We have engaged several orthopaedic companies for potential licensing opportunities.  All expressed interest in our intellectual property but give the early stages of design our group has created an LLC with plans for future progression to a C-corps to proceed with the startup route.  While we continue to learn more each day our experience through the NSF I-Corp program with the wealth of knowledge through their instructors was invaluable in providing a foundation on which we hope to build a successful startup and bring our intellectual property to the medical community and patients that are in desperate needs of new solutions.  Additionally, we have pursued support through additional funding mechanisms including the NSF PFI-TT and received favorable feedback.  We also plan to pursue SBIR/STTR funding in the near future.  Outside of the business experience we have also shared the information gained through the I-Corps program with our colleagues which has led to several other national cohort experiences from our institution.  We have also adapted the information learned and shared with our students through our work in academia.  While there are continued challenges ahead in the pursuit of commercialization of our technology we are grateful for the experience, the education and the opportunity afforded to us through the NSF I-Corps experience.
