<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award will provide The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) with an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer, an instrument capable of producing data on the relative abundance of chemical elements in many types of samples.  The instrument and the data produced will support a range of on-going and planned projects ranging from study of the nature and origin of saline groundwater, the origin and sourcing of dust, the cycling of nutrients in soils, and the quality of water treated through desalination and other methods to improve water quality. The instrument will also be used as a training tool for students from a broad range of backgrounds to investigate research questions in the Paso del Norte region and surrounding areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will be used to acquire an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer, with add-ons to allow for measurement in the far ultraviolet (UV) allowing for the analysis of halogens. The instrument will be used to identify and quantify the elemental composition of: 1) water samples; 2) soil and rock leachates; and 3) digestions of non-liquid biological and geological materials. The instrument will enable and expand diverse research and training in Earth, biological, and environmental sciences and civil engineering, as well as workforce training and scholastic development at The University of Texas at El Paso. The instrument (Horiba Ultima Expert) and nitrogen generator (Peak Scientific NG5000A) are ideal for elemental quantification in liquid samples from a broad range of matrixes, including the analysis of elements in very saline solutions corresponding to brines (up to and exceeding 300,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) which are found in sedimentary basins in the region. The new instrument will be used to produce data for studies on: 1) aqueous geochemistry in arid and saline systems; 2) dryland element cycling; and 3) evaluation and testing of brackish and saline water treatment methods. Access to such an instrument will advance continuing research on soil, water, and air quality in light of evolving agricultural, climatic, and land-use conditions. Given relative simplicity of sample operation and robust design of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometers, instrument acquisition will allow for direct-use experience and data utilization in student projects and coursework at both the graduate and undergraduate level. The instrument will be integrated in undergraduate research provides an exceptional training and experiences for students at UTEP, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Basic information about the quality and origin of water can be gleaned from quantification of its most abundant constituents. Historically, this has required running water samples on two or three different pieces of equipment, which is expensive and requires a lot of effort.  In this project we leveraged the provided funds to purchase an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES), which has capabilities that allows it to see more elements than a typical unit, and a nitrogen generator which prevents common gases in the air from blocking the view of those elements.  Thus, we get nearly the same result as the previous approach, but it only requires processing and analyzing samples using this single instrument, often in a single run. This new setup, which was installed in the Department of Earth, Environmental, and Resource Sciences at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) has moved past a state of develop and testing to one of producing data for numerous research and education projects.              On the application side, this instrumentation is ideal for the chemical analysis of extremely salty waters, many of which are produced from oil and gas wells. Every single day in the United States, million of gallons of these ?produced? waters, which are an inherent part of hydrocarbon development, are brought to the surface and handled and/or managed. Chemical analysis of these waters, including measurements from these NSF-supported instruments, provide insights into where and how fluids move in the deep subsurface, which is important information to allow for understanding potential impacts from subsurface fluid injection or withdrawal as part of numerous human activities, including subsurface CO2 injection and wastewater disposal.  Moreover, owing to the extreme salinity of these waters, they are a potential target or source for valuable minerals, including some required for the next generation energy supplies.  Early uses of this instrument involve the testing of produced waters to investigate the potential for economic concentrations of various mineral commodities.               Beyond oil and gas related work, this NSF-supported instrumentation has been used to quantify constituents in water and carbonate minerals in desert soils, as a means to better understand how various natural compounds are distributed in dryland environments.  As the largest population growth in the U.S. is in arid and semi-arid southwest, understanding how human activities (such as irrigated agricultural) disrupt or modify the natural distribution of elements, including salts that can affect soil health and carbon cycling, is a key area of research.  We are actively pursuing this topic and data produced from this setup is critical for helping us better understand and predict those changes.              Finally, despite the long name of the instrument, ICP-OES instruments are relatively simple to run and difficult to damage.  Thus it represents a fantastic tool for introducing the students and public to chemical analysis. The instrument is utilized to produce data for college classes at UTEP and will increasingly be used to show the public how water quality data are generated, during open-door public events now that COVID restrictions have largely rescinded.
