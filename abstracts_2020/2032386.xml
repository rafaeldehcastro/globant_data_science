<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The primary goal of this study is to inform existing models of academic and social engagement, and to develop interconnected theoretical models to capture the complex psychosocial, emotional, cognitive, academic, and career consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in the short and long term. The unprecedented nature and impact of the present pandemic (e.g., extreme social distancing measures, campus closures, an abrupt shift to online instruction, temporary closure of in person laboratory research, cancellation of most academic clubs and meetings; child and elder care responsibilities, family job loss, and death), requires a comprehensive and systematic study to assess and model the complex, evolving impacts on psychosocial, emotional, cognitive, academic, and career outcomes. Further, the unique impact of the pandemic on historically underrepresented minority communities highlights the pressing need for empirical research to help motivate and guide reforms and interventions to address the needs of historically underrepresented minority STEM academic communities.  With a racially, ethnically, gender, and age-diverse sample, this project aims to fill important scientific knowledge gaps in understanding and systematically evaluating the short- and long-term changes in psychosocial, academic, and career life experiences as well as inequalities in academic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team is investigating the following questions: 1) Are there disparities (as a function of age, disability, gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, nationality, and sexual orientation) in academic and psychosocial resource availability, support, and needs reported by STEM graduate, and postdoctoral historically underrepresented minority (URM) vs. non-URM scholars during the COVID pandemic? 2) Do the disparities or changes in academic and psychosocial factors impact core STEM identity and efficacy differentially for URM versus non-URM scholars? 3) How does mentor quality relationship and academic social support networks moderate the relationship between training and learning disruptions and COVID stressors, and STEM identity, efficacy and career intentions? 4) How does the study of scholars across the next 11 months inform and refine existing models of academic and social engagement to account for unique pandemic effects on academic, cognitive, career, emotional and psychosocial consequences for URM and non-URM STEM scholars?  The researchers will use a quasi-experimental longitudinal design and data will primarily be collected using on-line survey methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is funded by NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate program, which supports STEM education research to increase the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The COVID-19 pandemic had an immediate and profound impact on the academic, cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial functioning of college students. Across a sample of 1,089 undergraduates during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March&ndash;May 2020), particular aspects of the pandemic were associated with emotional functioning and mental health (Scenczy et al., under review). Specifically, greater COVID-19-related life changes (e.g., school/job moved online, forced to change where they lived) were associated with greater depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Moreover, greater concerns about school, home confinement, and basic needs were uniquely associated with greater depression symptoms, and greater COVID-19 infection concerns were associated with greater generalized anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was particularly damaging for marginalized populations. Sexual minorities, relative to heterosexuals, reported greater depression, anxiety, and intolerance of uncertainty and experienced less recovery of COVID-19-related trauma and intolerance of uncertainty across the pandemic (Shen et al., under review). Students with marginalized gender or Hispanic/Latinx identity also reported higher levels of depression and anxiety compared to their privileged counterparts, and Asian and multiracial students reported lower treatment use (Lin et al., under review). Asian, relative to White, students reported experiencing higher discrimination during the first month of the pandemic, and greater experienced discrimination was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety and lower levels of academic engagement (Inman et al., 2021 &ndash; <em>Stigma and Health</em>). The COVID-19 pandemic was also associated with notable changes in access to mental health supports. For example, 62% of students reported a loss of mental health support during the initial months of the pandemic, which was associated with more severe depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation (Ahuvia et al., 2022 &ndash; <em>Journal of American College Health</em>). Loss of support was also greatest amongst individuals who identified as sexual minorities. There is promising evidence that the loss of supports could be addressed by making them more accessible to those in need. Indeed, amongst undergraduate students, interest rates were higher for free mental health supports (70-72%) compared to at-cost supports (20-25%) (Ahuvia et al., under review).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2022<br>      Modified by: Bonita&nbsp;London</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
