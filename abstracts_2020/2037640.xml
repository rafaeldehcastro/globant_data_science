<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a novel technology to slow the progression of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). AD is a common and devastating disease that currently affects 1 in 3 seniors within the United States and will cost the nation over $1 trillion per year by 2050. The pathology of the disease has remained elusive through decades of study, and the field is awash in failed drug and device trials. The proposed technology helps reduce the impact of the disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores translation of an implantable technology that targets a AD pathway adjacent to the disease pathology.  It focuses on treatment reduction rather than curative outcomes. Initial outcome metrics will focus on biomarkers specific to the mechanism of the device and the longevity of effect.  Clinical outcomes will center on a battery of cognitive testing, including MOCA and MMSE scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
