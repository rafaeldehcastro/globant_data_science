<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[A neutrino is a subatomic particle that has no electrical charge and a very small mass. Neutrinos are one of the most abundant particles in the universe, but because they have very little interaction with matter, they are difficult to detect. In the last 20 years, remarkable progress has been made in understanding the fundamental nature of the neutrino, including measurements which have indicated that neutrinos must have a non-zero mass.  This leads to some very important questions.  What is the absolute mass of the neutrino?  Why are neutrino masses so small compared to other elementary particles?  How did the neutrino obtain a mass?   The answers to these questions could be intimately related to the neutrino being its own antiparticle, also known as a Majorana particle, and may explain the prevalence of matter over anti-matter in the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rare nuclear process, called neutrinoless double beta decay, is a powerful tool that can be used to investigate the Majorana nature of neutrinos.  This process, whereby two neutrons simultaneously transform into two protons with the emission of two electrons and no neutrinos, is extremely rare  and is  difficult to observe due to the vast number of similar processes that could occur inside an experimental detector.  A competitive experimental search requires a large quantity of the double beta decay isotope and exquisite suppression of backgrounds.  This award will support the Boston University group’s activities in an improved search for neutrinoless double beta decay in the KamLAND-Zen experiment located deep underground in Japan.  This award will engage undergraduates from diverse backgrounds through the Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Boston University.  At the same time, it will establish a pipeline of students and postdocs who are trained in advanced technical skills that are highly sought-after in academia, industry, and national laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KamLAND-Zen is a kiloton scale liquid scintillator based detector. Recently, the experiment started a new phase of data-taking using roughly 750 kg of 136-Xe instrumented inside the detector.  This award will support the following enhancements to KamLAND-Zen:  improved background suppression with state-of-the-art deep learning classification algorithms, an independent Bayesian analysis, and the implementation of  online event tagging software for the trigger system.  The substantial reduction of backgrounds offered by these enhancements will push the neutrinoless double beta decay half-life sensitivity of KamLAND-Zen all the way to 5×10^26 years.  This is almost a five-fold improvement over previous KamLAND-Zen measurements.  The enhancements developed under this award will set the stage for a major detector upgrade, called KamLAND2-Zen, that will aim for a half-life sensitivity greater than 2×10^27 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Our understanding of the fundamental nature of neutrinos has rapidly progressed in recent decades, yet we are still unable to some very basic questions. What is the absolute mass of the neutrino? Why are neutrino masses so small compared to other elementary particles? How did the neutrino obtain a mass? The answers to these questions could be intimately related to the neutrino being its own antiparticle, known as a Majorana particle and might also explain the absence of anti-matter in the universe.  This award supported a world-leading search for a hypothetical nuclear process, called neutrinoless double beta decay, with Xe-136 filled into the KamLAND-Zen neutrino detector.  An observation of Xe-136 undergoing neutrinoless double beta decay would provide direct proof that neutrinos are Majorana particles.  During the award period we developed a sophisticated machine learning tool called KamNet, which runs over event images in the KamLAND-Zen detector and classifies the events as either signal-like or background-like.  KamNet is optimized to suppress backgrounds in our neutrionless double beta decay search by combining a spherical convolution network (S2CNN) with a Convolutional Long Short-term Memory and attention mechanism (AttenConvLSTM).  We found that the S2CNN is ideal for preserving rotational invariance of 3D images created by events in the spherical KamLAND-Zen detector while the AttenConvLSTM is essential for preserving the temporal ordering of the 3D images.  Dedicated interpretability studies were performed with KamNet to understand which underlying physical features it was using to classify physics events in the KamLAND-Zen detector.  The performance and interpretability of KamNet were reported in Phys. Rev. C 107, 014323. Image 2 shows a schematic diagram of the AttentionConvLSTM with several layers, and a summary diagram of KamNet.  KamNet enabled KamLAND-Zen to perform the first neutrinoless double beta decay search in a region of phase space that had not been accessible by any other recent experiments.  We developed an independent analysis framework based on Bayesian statistical methods to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in KamLAND-Zen using the open source Bayesian Analysis Toolkit.  Our Bayesian analysis framework was used to increase the integrity of an alternative frequentist framework developed by our collaborators at the Research Center for Neutrino Science at Tohoku University.  The final results of both of our analyses were reported in a special feature article in Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 051801.  Image 1 shows KamLAND-Zen's limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass, which is related to the neutrinoless double beta decay half-life.  These results have started to probe theoretical models that predict the effective Majorana mass for the first time.  We are now looking to improve the sensitivity of KamLAND-Zen with improvements in our data analysis techniques and a series of major upgrades.  One upgrade we're focusing on is the development of a new data acquisition electronics system for KamLAND-Zen, called MoGURA2.  The MoGURA2 electronics are based on the RFSoC (Radio Frequency System-on-Chip) which emerged from recent developments with FPGAs in the telecommunication industry. MoGURA2 will allow us to veto cosmic ray backgrounds in the neutrinoless double beta decay search with much higher efficiency.  We began FPGA firmware development for MoGURA2 and developed a prototype of an analog front-end daughter board that provides intial shaping and amplification of the signals coming from the KamLAND-Zen detector.  The prototype analog board is shown in Image 3.  Very recently, we installed and tested an early version of a MoGURA2 board on a small-scale prototype detector in the Kamioka Observatory, in Japan.  The MoGURA2 prototype installation and testing is shown in Image 4.  The broader impact of this award was realized through the extensive training of students in areas of data science, electronics, and machine learning, all of which are highly sought-after in research and industry.  We also have an active Research Experiences for Undergraduates program that helps increase engagement for undergraduates in these research areas.
