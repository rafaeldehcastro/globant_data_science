<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[All aspects of society have been upended by COVID-19. While most research has understandably focused on clinical applications, how the ancestors of SARS-CoV2 survive and circulate in nature is vital to both prevent future epidemics and help health professionals develop therapeutic treatments. Because some bat species are natural carriers of many coronaviruses, including the closest known relatives of SARS-CoV-2, the team supported by this award will identify consistent differences between bats and other mammals likely involved in moderating infection by regulating virus entry and mounting an effective immune response. This project will address how bats escape illness despite carrying a wide range of viruses. As part of this work, the research team will develop educational displays related to the bat immunology for public display at the Museum of Texas Tech. Results for the study will also be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, and posted to shared data repositories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers supported by this award hypothesize there are consistent differences in the genes involved in the immune response pathways of bats compared to other mammals, such that: a) bats show disproportionate numbers of unique genomic adaptations; b) there is higher expression of immune system genes in bats than in comparable mouse and human tissues, and c) expression of genes involved in coronavirus cell entry in bats differs in RNA profile, limiting the extent pathogenesis when compared to humans and mice. To test these hypotheses, the team will analyze genome structure across diverse bats species, and differential expression analysis of different tissues, in the context of viral tropism and immune response. Resulting data will inform researchers and clinicians as they anticipate and treat these respiratory syndromes. This RAPID award is made by the Physiological and Structural Systems Cluster in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Although most research focuses on clinical applications, how the ancestors of SARS-CoV2 survive and circulate in nature is vital to both prevent future epidemics and help health professionals develop therapeutic treatments. Because some bat species are natural carriers of many coronaviruses, including the closest known relatives of SARS-CoV-2, we focused on finding molecular adaptations that could moderate infectious disease outcomes. Although we found several unique adaptations in bats involved in the immune response regulation, the most important findings were gene losses. We corroborated the loss of the entire PYHIN family, previously reported for a few bat species, with 37 species. This shared loss suggests the loss of the PYHIN family occurred before diversification among bats. In addition to the PYHIN family loss, we discovered losses in more genes involved in the inflammasome pathway, such as the ligands for the NKG2D activation, and losses of epithelial alpha and beta defensins. This is the first report of epithelial defensins contraction in bats. In contrast, we found gene expansions and evidence of positive selection on genes involved in pathogen defense and recognition, such as the MHC-I, cytokines, and APOBEC3. We propose these gene expansions and adaptive evolution may compensate for the shortcomings of a system-wide dampened inflammatory response. <br />The project had three major objectives: <br />1) Generate and analyze high-quality genome assemblies to identify the immunogenetic repertoire as well as species-specific adaptations in bats, and compare them to those in other mammals, including humans and mice. We expect to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gains and losses of genes encoding immunological pathways, duplications, and recombination events. <br />2) Combine whole genome analyses with transcriptomic data to discover how baseline (i.e., putatively healthy) immune systems express genes differently in bats and well-studied models such as humans and mice. Identification of differences in RNA expression across immune system genes from diverse tissues may help explain how the trajectory of bat viral exposure differs from that of other mammals. <br />3) Build and test an integrated immune/receptor model of bat gene expression across diverse tissues. Using published expression data available primarily from animal models, as well as currently unpublished data from bats, we will test this model and evaluate whether the molecular machinery of bats can generate a cytokine storm analogous to that experienced by human COVID-19 patients.<br /><br />Objective 1 is complete. We sequenced high-quality genome assemblies for four bat species. We annotated &gt;35 bats genomes and performed comparative genome analyses including gene family evolution, gene loss detection, and selection analyses between bats and six non-bat mammals as outgroups to analyze the immune repertoires of bats and compared with other mammals.<br />In addition, we made a whole genome alignment, including &gt;35 bat genomes, that is being used to achieve new objectives derived from our results obtained from objective 1. <br />Objective 2 is partially complete. Without biological replicates, between-species transcriptome data took longer than at first expected, but we now have a full pipeline culminating in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models of gene expression evolution and finding differential expression in key genes. We decided to combine results from this project and 2031906 for publication.<br />Objective 3 is in progress. While our genomic model is published, full model validation is proceeding with expression data. <br /><br />Broader Impacts: The COVID-19 pandemic itself was a hindrance to some objectives associated with this project but we were still able to implement most activities. With the closing of schools, we shifted our efforts in educating high school teachers to undergraduates in our respective courses and laboratories. Dr. Ray incorporated four undergraduate students in efforts to examine genome structure and gene family evolution in bats in comparison to other mammals. In addition, the genome assemblies generated by this project were actively used as part of two courses, Genomes and Society and Genomes and Genome Evolution. Dr. Davalos incorporated four graduate students into the project, all of whom were mentored in genomics techniques. <br />Thus far these awards have supported work associated with two publications: one in in Genes [1] and one in Molecular Ecology [2].
