<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[With support from NSF’s Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings and the Division of Undergraduate Education, this project will serve the national interest by exploring midscale approaches to improving STEM education for all students.  The award will fund a workshop that brings together education researchers and other key stakeholders to explore how NSF’s Mid-scale Research Infrastructure Big Idea could facilitate STEM education research. This Big Idea aims to address research infrastructure needs of the scientific, engineering, and STEM education fields by investing in the development of experimental research capabilities in the mid-scale range, defined as $20-70 million total project cost.  Mid-scale infrastructure funding is intended to support development, design, and construction of cutting-edge research infrastructure to support scientific advances. In the STEM education field, such investments have the potential to advance research on many topics, including the development of technologies for use in educational settings, models of education, and career pathways.  The results of this research could help the nation meet the learning needs of an increasingly diverse population at all stages of the learning lifecycle. Successful implementation of this workshop will produce a vision and a set of priorities for the mid-scale research infrastructure needed to support STEM education research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Mid-scale STEM Education Research Infrastructure will convene STEM Research education experts and stakeholders to exchange ideas about how mid-scale research infrastructure can advance the frontier of STEM education and to develop a community of stakeholders around this topic. Mid-scale research infrastructure is necessary to enable the advancement of knowledge about how best to educate all learners regarding STEM concepts and skills. Developing foundational skills and knowledge in STEM is an imperative for all students in primary and secondary education. At the postsecondary level, success in STEM is crucial to a broad range of professions and career pathways. Graduate training both prepares the researchers who will advance basic knowledge as well as the next generation of teachers and professors. Informal STEM educators also play a key role in providing opportunities to engage with STEM applications and concepts. Although much progress has been made across sectors in developing effective instructional practices in STEM, the proliferation of new technologies such as mixed reality and simulations, of computational applications across disciplines, and of interdisciplinary educational and career pathways will lead to new challenges and opportunities to be addressed by education research. This workshop aims to advance the nation’s STEM education by enhancing knowledge of relevant research infrastructure needs. The workshop will convene an interdisciplinary group of experts with the charge to identify opportunities and gaps that can inform the potential for mid-scale research infrastructure to advance STEM education research.  The resulting workshop summary will detail potential projects and identify anticipated near-term outcomes and long-term impacts of mid-scale STEM education research infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Education practitioners have only been able to artificially connect classroom instruction to the "real world," which has resulted in a general lack of authenticity in student learning experiences. Experts should develop flexible learning environments that enable students to pursue their own pathways and attain the disciplinary knowledge and skills needed to achieve their goals. Curriculum should be centered around students' experiences rather than organizational structures.</p> <p style="margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;">Participants described a potentially expanded role for technology in the future of STEM learning. Advances in technology can provide the scaffolding for more authentic forms of collaborative learning. Technology will help to eliminate the physical barriers posed by classroom walls and facilitate "anytime, anywhere" learning, including opportunities for collaboration with students outside of one's own classroom, school, or district. Educators can leverage technology to scale projects and expand student access to effective academic interventions, like personalized learning systems, automatic feedback, tailored performance assessments, and educational gaming.</p> <p style="margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>Dimensions of Student Experience</strong></p> <p style="margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;">The path to equity in STEM education has always been challenging, and the pandemic has further exacerbated opportunity and achievement gaps between underserved students and their peers. Low-income, transient students often move across administrative boundaries to access services, and traditional data and data infrastructures do a poor job in tracking them. Boundaries across school districts, across states, and between K-12 and postsecondary education all serve to hamper understanding and entrench inequity. Opportunities exist to create and expand data infrastructure to better understand students through social media and mobile phone data. These data sources are less affected by administrative silos that impede research using traditional data infrastructure.</p> <p style="margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;">Data infrastructure should reflect the expansive nature of student learning experiences while engaging learners from different communities. Digital toolkits may allow students from different schools, districts, or even states or countries to work together on projects across time and space, either synchronously or asynchronously. Multi-dimensional infrastructure would give researchers the opportunity to unify qualitative and quantitative teaching, administrative, and intervention data, identifying the multitude of influences on student choice and career pathways in STEM. It could also track important informal learning experiences that occur outside of the classroom. New assessment infrastructure is needed, as traditional metrics contain biases and do not reflect different forms of knowledge and ways in which students demonstrate knowledge.</p> <p style="margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>Connecting Disparate Data</strong></p> <p style="margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;">Silos are a major issue for STEM education research and data. Data not only come in a variety of unstandardized formats, but they are stored in distributed databases that are not widely accessible. Poor replicability and the small-scale nature of most education research has always been an issue in the field. In addition, the United States has numerous federal statistical agencies that each have their own rules and regulations, as well as myriad state agencies, school districts, and commercial vendors - all of which can be territorial about their data. Another important boundary exists between K-12 and higher education research.</p> <p style="margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;">Technologies, algorithms, and data repositories could be useful for tackling the big questions in education and allowing researchers to work across silos and expand collaboration. Methods, tools, and models need standardization as well as flexibility. An NSF-run data repository could be a first step in this direction. Other types of data repositories, platforms, and artificial intelligence applications could help with data-intensive areas of study, such as speech, psychometrics, and administrative data.</p> <p style="margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>Scaling and Implementation</strong></p> <p style="margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;">Current studies of STEM education are hampered by the complexity of the questions being studied and the barriers to collaboration and data gathering. Funding opportunities for research studies rarely account for the time that it takes to build relationships between researchers, educational agencies and institutions, and teachers. Teachers who are interested in taking part in education research are already overwhelmed with their own work requirements and cannot take on the additional burden of classroom-based data gathering. Even with teachers gathering information in their classrooms, it is difficult to obtain the granularity needed. Existing infrastructure does not encourage relationships between scholarly experts and researchers in the wider education community that may be mutually beneficial, particularly with respect to the sharing of data and research methods.</p> <p style="margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;">These deficiencies in the existing infrastructure point to the need for a better approach to implementation research and scaling of evidence-based practices. The ability to capture motion and affective states in an instructional environment could reduce the burden on faculty in collecting data. Implementation research can also benefit from large-scale networks or organizations that collect, clean, and manage data on STEM education.</p> <!-- @font-face  {font-family:"Cambria Math";  panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:roman;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}@font-face  {font-family:Calibri;  panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:swiss;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal  {mso-style-unhide:no;  mso-style-qformat:yes;  mso-style-parent:";  margin:0in;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p  {mso-style-priority:99;  mso-margin-top-alt:auto;  margin-right:0in;  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;  margin-left:0in;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;  mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";}.MsoChpDefault  {mso-style-type:export-only;  mso-default-props:yes;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1  {page:WordSection1;} --><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/17/2022<br>      Modified by: Jessica&nbsp;L&nbsp;Avery</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
