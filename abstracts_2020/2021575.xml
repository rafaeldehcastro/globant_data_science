<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a mobile software application (mobile app) for recreational boat operators mobile phones intended to reduce recreational boating accidents and fatalities. Such accidents result from three interrelated factors: the boat operator, the vessel, and the environment. This mobile app uses crowdsourcing data (directly from recreational boat operators) to provide boat operators with enhanced situational awareness when on the water; e.g., access to high resolution National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) charts, social connectivity, integrated tide/current data, automated float plan/tracking monitored by trusted friends or relatives, rapid access to emergency services, etc. The commercial pathway of this app is focused on providing the basic mobile app and related safety tools to the recreational boating public for free but offering more advanced (customer requested) features such as social connectivity and group tracking for an additional fee.  A second commercial pathway for this application is focused on (de-identified) data gathering of recreational boater on-the-water patterns and behavior.  These data have particular significance within the marine insurance industry for actuarial reasons and also have commercial potential within the commercial boating industry as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of current, sustainable, comprehensive, authoritative, non-accident based recreational boater data that is critical to the geospatial analytics needed to refine and better understand the nature and causality of recreational boat accidents.  The proposed mobile app is based on a formula where the space-time array of accidents relates to a space-time function of human, technological, and environmental factors. The primary technical hurdle is to develop a mobile app in a way that will be adopted broadly by recreational boaters and will thus facilitate the effective collection of real-time, crowdsourced data. This mobile app is intended to bridge the data gap between the scarcity of data currently available and the boating accident formula and in so doing more closely address the challenge of state and federal boating regulatory agencies; i.e., to reduce recreational boating accidents and fatalities. To accomplish this, a more optimal means of recreational boating data collection is required to better understand the underlying nature of accident causality. This mobile application is designed to enable that data collection, to enhance recreational boat operator safety (situational awareness), to reduce recreational boating accidents, and to save lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The main goal of our I-Corps Teams project has been to create a commercialization roadmap for the Self- Reporting Boat Operator Safety (SOBOS) mobile marine navigation and safety app, now rebranded as the SeaMe app. The project fills a critical, currently unaddressed recreational boating safety need for: (1) a high-quality mobile marine navigation application that includes situational awareness (e.g., boat operator risk alerts), (2) social connectivity (e.g., automated float plan monitoring, cruising group connections, marine facilities and services, etc.), and, most importantly, (3) real-time, on-water data collection.     This larger goal has included the following smaller goals:   Market validation: We have sought to assess the want and needs of potential customers, specifically by identifying who the paying customer is and who the user of the app is (and whether or not they are the same or different groups).   Identification of key customer segments: We have sought to identify which types of individuals from the groups a) recreational boaters and b) regulators of recreational boating are our specific customers.   Identification of key partners: We have sought to identify which organizations can most help us bring this product to market.      In order to accomplish this, we:   Interviewed over 150 different prospective customers   Worked to analyze this data through import into SPSS in order to identify key patterns, trends, and results   Worked to render this analysis into key customer personas that have expressed a need we can meet   Kept in touch with potential key partners who have expressed interest in the project in the past   Identified new opportunities for additional customer discovery   Identified new opportunities for additional funding      Eventually we hit a bit of a roadblock in our customer discovery efforts due to the PI moving to a new institution in 2022 as well as the introduction of numerous competitors into the marketplace. We have personally witnessed 5 new mobile apps enter this marketplace since the inception of this grant, which has made differentiating our project very difficult.
