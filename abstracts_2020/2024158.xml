<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The 2020 IEEE North American School for Information Theory (NASIT ’20) will be held at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, from July 8th to July 10th, 2020. This award supports travel expenses for US graduate students attending the school. These participants benefit by learning from senior colleagues, presenting their own research in poster sessions, and expanding their network with their community, as well as honing professional development skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE North American School for Information Theory is an annual event of the IEEE Information Theory Society; this will be the school's seventh year of operation. The School provide a supportive environment where foundations for learning and long-term future scientific collaborations are established. The School delivers interactive education for graduate students in the mathematical, engineering, and computer science aspects espoused by modern information theory, and offers students the opportunity to meet with and learn from senior researchers from academia and industry who present long-format tutorials. Student participants present their own research results in poster sessions. The IEEE Information Theory Society “Padovani Lecture” is delivered at the school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

All of the tutorials videos and slides were posted on the NASIT 2022 website. In addition, the school included an overview of the NSF in information theory, followed by various panel discussions: young faculty on academic careers, industry internships and careers in information theory, and industrial researchers on how information theory is used for future 6G technology. The program also featured poster sessions where each graduate student attendee presents about their current research or an interesting area of information theory. As an exciting break, NASIT attendees spent an afternoon to visit the Los Angeles Getty Center.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/01/2023<br>      Modified by: Yu&nbsp;Xiang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677700573567_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677700573567_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677700573567_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">students participants</div> <div class="imageCredit">IT school</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yu&nbsp;Xiang</div> <div class="imageTitle">students</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677700929395_poster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677700929395_poster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="poster session"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677700929395_poster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="poster session"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">student poster presentations</div> <div class="imageCredit">IT school</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yu&nbsp;Xiang</div> <div class="imageTitle">poster session</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677702070428_tutorial1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677702070428_tutorial1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="tutorial speaks 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677702070428_tutorial1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="tutorial speaks 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">tutorial speakers 1</div> <div class="imageCredit">IT school</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yu&nbsp;Xiang</div> <div class="imageTitle">tutorial speaks 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677702128651_tutorial2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677702128651_tutorial2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="tutorial speakers 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677702128651_tutorial2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="tutorial speakers 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">tutorial speakers 2</div> <div class="imageCredit">IT school</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yu&nbsp;Xiang</div> <div class="imageTitle">tutorial speakers 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677702943040_studentactivities--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677702943040_studentactivities--rgov-800width.jpg" title="student activities"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024158/2024158_10658501_1677702943040_studentactivities--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="student activities"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">student activities</div> <div class="imageCredit">IT school</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yu&nbsp;Xiang</div> <div class="imageTitle">student activities</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
