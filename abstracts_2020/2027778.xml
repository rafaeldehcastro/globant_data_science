<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the shortcomings in existing technologies for viral detection and identification.  The lack of widespread availability of testing, combined with a high rate of false negative tests, contribute to quarantine failure and confusion among health authorities and the public.  The investigator proposes to combine biosensing and biophotonics approaches to develop and demonstrate a rapid, room temperature, single-step, virus-specific, and ultrasensitive digital resolution assay for COVID-19 that can be performed immediately after sample collection at the point of care, and provide a result in less than 15 minutes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his group recently demonstrated that a photonic crystal surface can amplify the scattering of light from surface-attached nanoparticles, including virions, and that a new form of biosensor microscopy called Photonic Resonator Interference Scattering Microscopy (PRISM) can detect and digitally count the virus particles in real time, without the use of additional labels or stains.  These technologies will be rapidly adapted and tested for COVID-19 detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

By detecting intact COVID in saliva, diagnostic tests can be performed in a single step with minimal sample processing with the result available in minutes from sample to answer at costs &lt;$1.50/test.  With the ability to provide sensitivity on par with laboratory PCR tests, we will be better prepared to rapidly deploy diagnostic tests to better manage future pandemics impacting human and animal populations.
