<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will develop a diesel/biodiesel certificate track in the Associate of Applied Technologies in Automotive Technology degree. This track is intended to address regional needs for diesel technicians who have the specialized technical skills needed to support current and emerging agricultural and urban applications. Employers across Illinois and the country have an urgent need for skilled diesel mechanics and there is a growing need for a workforce that can plan, design, build, and repair transportation systems and energy-efficient vehicles. The project will increase student interest in next-generation diesel technician careers by implementing strategies to serve underrepresented and underserved students with a dual focus on rural and urban schools. By preparing students for careers in high-growth technical fields, the project has the potential to advance innovative methods for meeting the nation's changing employment needs. This project will generate evidence regarding effective practices for using learning communities in rural technician education. Outreach and recruiting efforts will replicate successful efforts from other ATE projects that have been successful in engaging underrepresented students. Results will be disseminated throughout Illinois and to the ATE community. The project supports ATEâ€™s focus on rural technician education aligned with in-demand careers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to develop pathways to next-generation diesel/biodiesel technologies careers with a primary focus on providing a skilled workforce equipped to fill jobs in rural and urban sectors. The objectives of the project are: 1) implement a new diesel/biodiesel technology pathway program with stackable credentials; 2) train secondary and post-secondary faculty to recruit students, implement curriculum and instruction, collaborate with industry, and support rural and urban student success in technician education and careers; and 3) increase partnerships with rural and urban diesel technology employers to expand career opportunities for students and meet local and regional workforce needs. The project will improve student outcomes by providing secondary school educators with professional development and customized skill-training modules, emphasizing dual-enrollment courses, leveraging partnerships to provide students with 21st century work-based learning, and aligning curricula with industry standards. The project intends to produce these deliverables: aligned curriculum, new courses and a certificate in diesel/biodiesel technology, stackable credentials leading to college degrees, work-based learning, and recruitment and outreach collateral designed to engage underrepresented students. Graduates will be ready for work with industry partners, thus contributing to the nation's skilled technical workforce. Project materials and results will be widely shared and disseminated through statewide and national meetings. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Building a Pipeline of Biodiesel Technicians for Careers in Fields and Cities   Grant at Lewis and Clark Community College (L&amp;C) in Godfrey, Illinois developed an educational pathway preparing students to meet the challenges of the growing and evolving diesel/biodiesel technology sector.  Directed by principal investigator Professor Christopher E. Reynolds, M.S.Ed., the Diesel/Biodiesel Technology program now serves as the only postsecondary option of its kind available in the Illinois counties Lewis &amp; Clark Community College serves.  The key components of the initiative entail: 1) development of new diesel/biodiesel courses, 2) accreditation approval for a college-level certificate in diesel/biodiesel technology, 3) STEM-based professional development and customized instructional modules for secondary and postsecondary faculty, 4) targeted outreach strategies designed to engage underserved rural and urban students, 5) stackable credentials through a 2+2+2 pathway model; and, 6) work-based learning activities and internships with diesel/biodiesel industry partners.  Key impacts include:  Establishment of Diesel industry representatives for the Lewis &amp; Clark Community College Automotive Technology Advisory Committee; Development and integration of three (3) credit-bearing courses into the diesel technology curriculum: DTEC 241, Intro to Diesel Engine Repair; DTEC 243, MHDT Brakes, Steering, &amp; Suspension; and DTEC 246 MHDT Electricity &amp; Electronics; Collaboration with area high schools to establish dual credit for students in high school general education/STEM courses; Approved by Illinois Community College Board for Certificate of Proficiency in Diesel Technology; Student/faculty participation in work-based learning with industry partners (e.g., American Lung Association, Bendix Brake Systems, BiState Development [St. Louis' MetroLink public transportation system], Central Illinois Trucking, Agency for Community Transit/Madison Country Transit, Diesel Laptops, VacTruck Rentals, Area Diesel Service, and Illinois Soybean Association).  Experiences included apprenticeships, student employment, onsite observations, as well as onsite and online training; and High school visits and college recruitment events (on and off-campus).   Grant activities also encouraged the development of private awards for student scholarships through the founder of the Agency for Community Transit/Madison County Transit that will support the development of future diesel service and diagnostic technicians in the Riverbend region.
