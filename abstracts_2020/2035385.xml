<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project will organize and host a workshop to expand collaboration among stakeholders in academia, industry, state and federal government, and community sectors to develop carbon capture and sequestration as a potential topic for a future topic (track) of the NSF Convergence Accelerator. Carbon capture and sequestration has the potential to be an impactful part of efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Substantial reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels has the potential to slow climate impacts, providing benefits to U.S. society and global communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the technical hurdles to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) have been surmounted or discussed in other events. The key value of this event is engaging a range of stakeholders to develop a potential Convergence Accelerator topic that considers the risks, challenges, and opportunities of CSS. The stakeholders who will be engaged include researchers in the geosciences, engineering, and economics, representatives from the petroleum industry and environmental stewardship organizations, policymakers, community organizations including Tribal groups, and also state and federal agencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will help define how technological, economic, legal, political, and community challenges related to CCS can be assessed and addressed in a Convergence Accelerator track. If that track were to be selected, it could allow multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder teams to expand pilot projects in ways that appropriately address risk, address community concerns, provide strong economic benefits through development of sequestration infrastructure, and have a measurable effect on atmospheric CO2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

For example, future distributed CO2 storage projects should include engagement with community leaders during the design, development, implementation, and maintenance stages. Hurdles in resource policies at the state level, and purposeful engagement of the energy workforce - currently battling an economic downturn, are required if a multi-pronged approach is to succeed.

Such "blue energy" (H2 produced from natural gas by catalysis) or even "green" fossil fuel production (secondary petroleum recovery coupled with CO2 capture) are ripe for convergence and acceleration across multiple disciplines.

In turn, utilization of the reservoir-stored resources require an economic model that honors the societal needs throughout the geographically diverse US.   Finally, large-scale CO2 capture, transport, utilization, and long-term storage require on-roading from existing energy infrastructure and expertise. An efficient carbon economy that removes and stores Gt-scale emissions can benefit by on-ramping or on-roading from existing industry infrastructure and talent. Development of strategies geared towards increased resilience through storage in stacked reservoirs at one site and multiple capture streams at different price points would decrease uncertainty and advance investment in CCUS technologies.   Whether the CO2 is released at a power plant, fertilizer plant, or a car tailpipe, a planet that climatologically sustains life requires the removal of that CO2 either from the production stream or actively removing it from the atmosphere. A world where it is adopted on a scale to make any impact in a decade requires substantial and swift action. This can be accomplished with input from the public, scientists, government, entrepreneurs, and numerous industries.
