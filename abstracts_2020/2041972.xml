<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The way in which electricity flows through a material depends critically on its constituent atoms and their precise arrangement. For example, although graphite and diamond are both composed purely of carbon atoms, the former is a metal whereas the latter is an electrical insulator. Each atomic layer of graphite consists of a perfect two-dimensional lattice of carbon atoms called graphene. Synthetic materials can be created by stacking a small number of graphene sheets atop one another with precise lattice alignments and twist angles, thereby controlling the arrangement of all of the constituent carbon atoms. These structures host novel electronic properties that are dominated by strong interactions amongst the electrons and other quantum mechanical effects. This project investigates new device architectures in which multiple sheets of graphene are carefully stacked and twisted in previously unexplored ways, and additionally develops experimental techniques to dynamically control the properties and functionality of these novel quantum electronic devices. The success of this project may lead to the development of new quantum technologies for low-power electronics and quantum information. The project integrates educational, training, and mentoring opportunities for students in the rapidly growing field of quantum nanotechnology, including a hands-on summer outreach activity for high school students and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Stacking and twisting atomically thin van der Waals crystals atop one another can lead to the emergence of flat electronic bands with nontrivial topology. These systems host novel correlated topological states of matter that can be dynamically tuned within a single device. The objective of this project is to discover new correlated topological states in an assortment of structures assembled by stacking mixed-and-matched sheets of monolayer, bilayer, or trilayer graphene with controlled interfacial twist angles. This research utilizes low-temperature electronic transport in order to probe the quantum anomalous Hall effect that arises in these structures owing to the emergence of orbital magnetism and topological Chern insulator states. Furthermore, this project employs a combination of hydrostatic pressure, electrostatic screening, and electric field tuning in order to achieve dynamic control of the Chern number â€“ the quantized topological invariant characterizing the system. Developing new Chern insulators with large and tunable Chern number presents opportunities for creating future energy-efficient devices with dissipationless charge transport, as well as for potential quantum computing applications. The research project and associated outreach activities train a broad range of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in state of the art techniques in quantum nanoelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
