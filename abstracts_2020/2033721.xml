<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will develop an innovative and efficient advanced manufacturing method to substantially reduce costs of thin coating processes. This innovation will lead to a significant reduction of production costs of goods such as energy-efficient and smart windows, solar panels, thin-film solid-state batteries, electronic displays and many others, therefore encouraging further adoption of modern and energy-efficient technologies in the society. The successful commercialization of this technology will therefore benefit the environment through increased building efficiency and solar generation and improving availability and functionality of advanced electronics with lower cost components in displays. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes development of a novel process for additive manufacturing of rotary sputter targets for very high thermal conductivity precious metals, such as silver. Benefits include 50% lower initial infrastructure investment costs compared to the traditional rotary target manufacturing processes (such as casting) and 30% lower sputtering process costs with respect to other rotary targets of comparable purity. The proposed research and development activities will focus on overcoming the main technical risks and challenges, including managing the considerable heat dissipation in highly thermally conductive metals while producing rotary targets. The research will also address technical difficulties related to increasing power capacity and creating a full-scale prototype capable of producing targets of sufficient size for the industry. This will be the first reliable method for producing silver rotary targets with the uniformly small grain size and minimal gas content of a cast target at a competitive cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project focused of the optimization of electron beam based additive manufacturing for use in manufacturing of high purity rotary sputtering targets. The Continuous Micro Casting (CMC) process was optimized to melt silver and tin wire directly onto internally water-cooled tubes which are then used as sputtering targets for large area thin film deposition processes to create products such as low-e glass. The CMC process was developed to eliminate many technical issues and high expense associated with the traditional casting, hot isostatic pressing, and thermal/cold spray processes currently used in the precious metal rotary sputtering target industry. The CMC process can create small grain size targets with less gas incorporation than what is in the feed stock material and with lower production costs than a traditional casting process. The additive manufacturing of the CMC process enables precious metals such as silver to be deposited at the dimensions required by the customer without the need to deposit extra material and machine it back off to attain the correct dimension and surface finish for the final product. The electron beam can be utilized to smooth the final material surface to a finish acceptable for sputtering processes without removing any of the material. Additionally, the CMC process enables sputtering targets to be reused. After the consumable material has been completely exhausted in a sputtering process, the remaining material on the backing tube can be put back into a CMC system to be recoated back to the original sputtering target specifications. The direct reusability of these consumable precious metal sputtering targets reduces the total volume of precious metals that customers must keep on hand for production by at least a factor of 3.

An extensive exploration of the water-cooling efficiency was conducted to determine the optimal operating parameters and baffle design for the internal water cavity of the backing tube. Even with improved water cooling, the electron beam source power had to be decreased until the temperature of the backing tube in the melt pool was just at or above the wetting temperature of the silver.
