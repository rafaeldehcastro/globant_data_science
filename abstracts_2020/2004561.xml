<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This travel grant provides support for 15 US-based students to attend the 32nd Winter School on Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation (VMCAI) to be held in New Orleans, January 2020. VMCAI, one of the premier conference in formal verification, provides a forum for researchers from the communities of Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation, facilitating interaction, cross-fertilization, and advancement of hybrid methods that combine these and related areas. The VMCAI winter school will give students the knowledge required to enter the field and present them with some of the newer research directions in the field. Students have much to gain from attending winter school's learning state-of-the-art methodologies, being exposed to new research questions, and interacting with senior researchers in their chosen area of expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences like the VMCAI winter school is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer science researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class researchers in formal methods, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers. This project aims at increasing the participation of students from underrepresented groups and those from smaller institutions of education, to provide them with equal opportunities, rather than leave them behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
