<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Sarah Wellons is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at Northwestern University.  She will perform large-scale computer simulations to study the lifecycle and properties of massive distant galaxies in the early Universe and to understand how they differ from nearby galaxies.   Results from this study will allow astronomers to accurately interpret observations of early galaxies.  Along with this research, Wellons will develop an astronomy course for incarcerated students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wellons will employ a combination of large-volume and as zoom-in simulations to investigate key aspects of massive galaxies at high redshifts (&gt; 2).  The simulations will explore mechanisms that quench star formation, connect physical processes at large and small size scales, and govern the kinematic evolution of massive galaxies through cosmic time.  This work will provide theoretical context for puzzling observations of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts, as well as set expectations for future observations of increasingly distant galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the time I was supported as an NSF Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow, I worked to better understand how galaxies are born, grow, and eventually become "red and dead."  In particular, I studied the relationship between galaxies and the supermassive black holes they host.  The two are observed to co-evolve, with the galaxy feeding the black hole fuel to grow, and the black hole in turn giving off strong winds and relativistic jets which can affect the intergalactic and circumgalactic media and regulate (or stop) the formation of new stars within the galaxy.  I used high-resolution "zoom-in" simulations of galaxies as a theoretical tool to examine various models for how galaxies and black holes grow and interact.  I led scientific publications on the relationship between galaxies' dynamical masses (the sum of all mass components including dark matter, gas, stars, and black holes) and the speed of rotation in their disks, and on a study of a large suite of simulations exploring different ways to model black hole physics to learn about the properties of such models which lead to realistic regulation of star formation in the host galaxies.  I also contributed to numerous other publications on, e.g., the relationship between galaxies' central surface densities and black hole growth, the types of jets produced by active galactic nuclei, and the predictions made by our models for observables such as the distribution of luminosities of accreting black holes.  In addition to my scientific research, I worked with the Northwestern Prison Education Program to teach college-level, credit-bearing introductory astronomy classes to men and women incarcerated in Illinois state prisons.  I developed and refined a set of course materials for use in this atypical classroom environment, and have passed them on to future instructors for continued use.
