<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) have emerged as a promising heat engine for a wide range of applications because they can respond quickly and efficiently to remote and sudden electricity demands. High-efficiency TPVs could facilitate the growth of renewable sources such as solar and wind through the development of thermal-energy electrical storage (TEES) and distributed combined heat and power (CHP). As an alternative to batteries, TEES is one of the most affordable approaches for grid-scale storage of electricity. Distributed CHP, on the other hand, is a promising alternative to centralized power plants that waste approximately two-thirds of primary energy and offer limited dispatchability. Recent progress in optical and photovoltaic materials have advanced TPVs toward practical implementation. However, further progress requires a more complete understanding of which aspects of current TPV designs are favorable and where opportunities for improvements remain. This is challenging for TPVs because of the broad application space, wide range of operating conditions, and a lack of available modeling tools that facilitate design. Addressing these barriers through the development of an open-access platform is the goal of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project TPV will facilitate an Explore-Design-Report closed-loop process. Users can interact with the platform to Explore leading approaches which have been identified by comparing each conversion step to its respective, experiment-specific thermodynamic limit. Meaningful comparisons will allow researchers to learn which aspects of current TPVs are favorable and to translate improvements from one material system to another, accelerating progress in the field. The Design module will let users predict the performance of existing and hypothetical architectures using a TPV quasi-one-dimensional simulation tool (TPV-Q1D). TPV-Q1D will advance fundamental understanding of energy loss mechanisms in TPV cells and bridge the existing gap in open-access tools by accounting for variable emitter parameters, dopant-mediated parasitic absorption, spatially dependent photoexcitation and recombination, and nanostructured layers. The Report module will allow users to upload the results of their experimental measurements, including dark and illuminated current-voltage characteristics and spectral properties of emitters and cells. Upon verification by the project team, these data will become available in the Explore module, closing the design loop. To engage the broader community, guided learning activities will show users how to interact with Project TPV to understand fundamental energy conversion steps and design principles that have led to major improvements over the years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
