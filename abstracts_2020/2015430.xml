<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation for the Research Vessel Savannah, a 92-foot coastal research vessel, owned and operated by Skidaway Institute of Oceanography as part of the Academic Research Fleet (ARF). The primary working area for the vessel has been the continental shelf, coastal and estuarine environments of the Southeastern United States. The ship has also conducted cruises that have crossed the Gulf Stream into the western Sargasso Sea and as far as Curacao in the SE Caribbean. The R/V Savannah has been specifically designed with a large science berthing capacity to provide learning opportunities in ocean and estuarine environments and to demonstrate oceanographic research methodologies to diverse and often under-served student populations.  In 2019, the R/V Savannah completed 86 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 15 days (18%) of the total sailing schedule. In 2020, the vessel currently has 142 days scheduled, of which 89 days (63%) are for NSF. With this proposal, Skidaway provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trace Element Clean Water Sampling System $166,871&lt;br/&gt;Bottle Sampling Space Infrastructure $7,449&lt;br/&gt;Year 2 Sampler Blank Analysis $8,305&lt;br/&gt;      $182,625&lt;br/&gt;      &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project award funded the purchase of specialized water-column sampling system designed to collect contamination-free seawater samples from ships in the UNOLS fleet. Trace element research can be challenging because the elements of interest are found at low concentrations in the marine environment. In addition, these elements (such as iron, manganese, copper, and zinc) are common in traditional sampling systems and in the materials that are used to construct the ships. Thus, samples are susceptible to contamination during collection and processing. To reduce this risk, sampling systems have been designed which eliminate contaminating materials as much as possible. The system funded by this project includes an epoxy-coated aluminum carousel rosette which serves as the frame. This frame can be lowered over the side of the ship on a non-metallic cable. The rosette includes mounting points for 12 water-column sampling bottles. These bottles have virtually eliminated metal components and are constructed of Teflon-lined PVC. If used with a conducting cable, these bottles can be triggered to close at specific depths. However, this system also includes an auto-fire module which allows the bottles to be triggered at preset times and eliminates the need for a conducting cable. The system also includes a profiling CTD which records water conductivity, temperature, and pressure. Additional sensors measure dissolved oxygen and fluorescence along the profile.</p> <p>The system includes all the equipment required by oceanographers conducting research on trace elements in the marine environment. The whole system, or a sub-package, is available by request from the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography through an online request form. In addition to the equipment, the management team will provide written instructions along with video tutorials and be available to consult on system operation.
