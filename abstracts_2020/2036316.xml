<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a rapid, inexpensive, and ultra-high throughput test to screen patients for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The proposed test will facilitate population-wide screening for prior exposure, giving epidemiologists and policy-makers insight into the virus's spread and the frequency of asymptomatic cases. Individuals will understand their levels of risk (e.g., someone with strong immunity may be protected from re-infection in the near-term) to make informed decisions.  The proposed technology will be a quantitative test, which may allow immunity level to be correlated with disease severity or other parameters. The proposed test can be adapted easily to query multiple antigens simultaneously to address more complex medical assessments. Beyond the current pandemic, this flexible technology will be useful for exposure testing for diverse pathogens and immunogens in applications ranging from epidemiology to vaccine development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a novel method for ultra-high throughput serology testing.  Briefly, high density arrays of patient samples will be queried with fluorescently labeled COVID-19 antigens to identify patients with antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For the proposed project: Sample preparation and arraying (printing) techniques and workflows will be optimized. Assay probes (Covid-19 antigens) and conditions will be optimized using spiked samples and commercially purchased sera from patients, purchased commercially and deidentified.  The assay's sensitivity and specificity will be measured using anti-COVID (50 samples) and non-reactive (100 samples) sera. Finally, given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is related to other coronaviruses––some of which regularly circulate in humans, the potential for assay probes to cross-react with antibodies raised against previous (i.e., non-COVID) infections will be determined. The results of the proposed work will provide proof-of-concept for massively parallel, population-level serology screening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

For an ultra-high-throughput antibody detection assay to function in either an epidemic or pandemic response, many logistical elements are needed. The proposed project aimed to uncover those while showing proof-of-concept.  Our platform tested commercially acquired pure antibodies at levels which could be found in individuals recovering from an infection. This was successful using our system (the Bio-ID800).   One core component of the novel testing method was the printing/arraying of patient serum samples onto the Bio-ID sample processing cartridges. However, printing of the serum samples onto our Bio-ID cartridges became a challenge we hadn?t anticipated. We quickly turned to well established methods for processing samples for improved printing, but even those had a negative impact on overall detection limits.    Work is still required to determine the components of human serum that interfere with microarray printing and better methods of concentration and purification of IgG from serum.   We tested three different approaches for purification and saw consistent truncation of our signal, which indicates either a serum inhibitor is present that co-purifies with IgG, or another explanation exists that we have yet to elucidate. This information was helpful not only for our work on this assay, but also for additional projects within our business.   Separately, fluorescent-protein tagged viral antigens were unsuccessful at identifying control antibodies, however with commercially sourced material (and an alternative conjugation technique) we could detect the fluorescently-labeled SARS-CoV-2 antigens in a format that could be ultra-high-throughput.  The issues surrounding our fluorescent-protein tag may have been due to the size of the protein and its behavior in our assay cartridge. There are many advantages for future manufacturing to an approach where the fluorescent label is a protein made at the same time as the test antigen, but additional work is needed.   Despite not advancing as far as we hoped due to the technical hurdles, this provided us with a clear view of the technical hurdles to be overcome and showed that this approach is possible for measuring large numbers of patient serum samples at once.
