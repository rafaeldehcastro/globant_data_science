<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project focuses on designing control mechanisms for a networked system with unknown structure by making use only of non-invasive observations. By non-invasive observations, it is meant that what is being measured is not the system reaction to actively injected inputs, but rather the system behavior when it is operating under standard conditions and subject to potentially unobservable forcing signals. The capability of designing controllers based only on non-invasive observations is of paramount importance for any large scale network fulfilling critical or uninterruptible functions (i.e., a power grid, a logistic system) or in situations where it is impractical or too expensive to inject known probing signals into the system (i.e., a gene network, a financial network). Other relevant applications are in medicine (i.e., repeated drug testing, computer- assisted anesthesia). Indeed, in these cases, for obvious safety and health concerns, it is not desirable to actively test the response of a patient to a different drug dosage or treatment, if comparably useful information could be inferred from non-invasive observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since non-invasive observations do not always provide full information about the network's configuration, the project will also consider how to define adequate control mechanisms that are robust with respect to uncertainties in the connectivity structure. These kinds of uncertainties are not typically considered in standard techniques for control design and the development of specific methodologies is required. Combined with the capability of adapting to changes in the network's configuration, these control techniques will provide a solid foundation for the realization of a self-healing system. This project will bridge together different areas, including statistics, computer science, and control theory with a single unifying framework. New courses will be created to facilitate communication among all these communities of researchers, advancing separate fields in a multidisciplinary way.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The implementation of in-line controllers in large infrastructures offers numerous advantages, which include (i) an increased uptime of system, since such controllers can be replaced or added without a complete shut down; (ii) higer flexibility given by the fact that controllers can be added and removed  without any major disruption; (iii) improved reliability, because hot pluggable controllers can be replaced quickly in the event of a failure; (iv) scalability, since they can be designed to operate at a local level via distributed algorithms.  This can be particularly useful for infrastructures that require continuous operation, such as power grids, transportation systems, manufacturing facilities, and smart cities. However, the complex and dynamic nature of these infrastructures can make it difficult to design and implement hot-pluggable controllers, especially when uncertainties exist in the network topology.  To address this issue, a general framework for the design of in-line controllers has been developed, which is robust to uncertainties in the connectivity structure of the system. The approach is based on network identification and reconstruction procedures that rely on observational data of the infrastructure. Various methods have been developed to estimate the current system topology in different scenarios, including radial networks, junction trees, networks with no feedback loops, and networks with localized delays.  From a theoretical perspective, these identification procedures are guaranteed to asymptotically provide a class of networks compatible with the observed data, and methods from the theory of graphical models can be used to verify if a controller is stabilizing for all networks in the class. In order to obtain an implementation of these methodologies in the presence of finite data, several techniques based on statistical testing and maximumlikelihood estimation have been developed, as well.  Overall, this framework can help improve the functionality and safety of large infrastructures, despite the potential uncertainties in their network topology.
