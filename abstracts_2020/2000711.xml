<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This project aims to serve the national interest by identifying strategies to support students’ understanding of experimental science. The major goal is to identify instructional strategies that better prepare undergraduate students for doing authentic scientific experimentation in physics labs. Traditional laboratory exercises have trained students to view instructional laboratories as places to do rote procedures that lead to known results. This project will probe how to help students reframe their expectations so that they consider physics labs as places to engage in scientific experiementation.  Specifically, this project intends to identify strategies that help students think of physics labs as places where they will design their own experiments and draw their own conclusions from the data they collect. By working across multiple institutions, the project will provide many examples of students’ authentic science laboratory activities, as well an extensive database of students' work and engagement. The latter will document the rich diversity of resources and experiences students bring from their diverse backgrounds to their science laboratory work.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to understand student experiences in non-traditional science labs, specifically physics, through the theoretical lens of framing. A person's frame is defined here as a stable (either local or more global) set of expectations about the activity taking place. Prior literature suggests that small things can influence the ways students frame an instructional activity, which in turn can have a large impact on student learning. This research project is designed to (a) identify the various ways students frame activities in a diverse set of non-traditional labs, (b) identify ways students shift or change how they frame lab activities, and (c) formulate testable predictions for ways to help students develop stable, productive frames for experimental science. This project is supported by the EHR Core Research program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to serve the national interest by identifying strategies to better prepare science students to do original research. Too often, traditional laboratory exercises have trained students to expect to follow rote procedures and confirm known results. This project explored how to support students to learn and to use practices of authentic scientific research in instructional laboratories. By documenting and analyzing students' expectations across multiple institutions, this project provided many examples of successful authentic science lab activities, as well as an extensive database of students' work and engagement.     This project evaluated student experiences in non-traditional science labs, specifically physics, through the theoretical lens of framing. Framing here means forming a sense of what is taking place in some situation; a frame is a stable set of expectations based on past experiences. Students’ past experiences of labs designed to guide them toward predetermined results, for example, can structure their expectations for their next labs. Prior research suggests that the ways students frame an instructional activity impact how they behave and how they learn.     We identified several frames that students exhibit in their introductory physics labs, defined by the types of experimental predictions they hold and their sense of epistemic agency (authority to generate knowledge through their investigations):    &bull; Hoops &mdash; students expect that they must satisfy a sequence of required steps,    mandated by authority (i.e., jump through a set of hoops), with no articulated experimental prediction and low epistemic agency;    &bull; Low Agency-Confirmation &mdash; students expect that the experiment will confirm (or prove) a predicted result that they explicitly articulate and indicate low epistemic agency;    &bull; Low Agency-Falsification &mdash; students expect that the experiment will falsify (or disprove) a predicted result that they explicitly articulate and indicate low epistemic agency;    &bull; High Agency-Confirmation &mdash; students expect that the experiment will confirm (or prove) a predicted result that they explicitly articulate, but indicate higher epistemic agency, such as to obtain a different result;    &bull; High Agency-Falsification &mdash; students expect that the experiment will falsify (or disprove) a predicted result that they explicitly articulate, but indicate higher epistemic agency, such as to obtain a different result;    &bull; Discovery &mdash; students expect that the experiment will generate some result, with no articulated experimental prediction and high epistemic agency to generate their own conclusions.    Students’ behaviors associated with these frames indicated that the high agency frames were most often associated with productive scientific practices (such as forming conclusions based on data rather than external authority and conducting follow-up investigations to explore results). Furthermore, epistemic agency, rather than experimental predictions, was more indicative of productive scientific practices. For example, students exhibiting confirmation framings could still engage in productive problem solving and troubleshooting when results disagreed with their expectations.    The research also evaluated ways students shift or change how they frame lab activities and how instructors can successfully (and unsuccessfully) support such shifts. The analysis found that students had an easier time shifting their experimental predictions than their epistemic agency in response to instructor bids to shift frames. The results provide testable predictions for ways instructors can help students develop stable, productive frames for experimental science.
