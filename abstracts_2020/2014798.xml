<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the development of a new method to conduct infrared spectroscopy, an important tool in the life sciences, materials development and pharmaceutical industries. Chemical producers will spend an estimated $140 million on analytical instrumentation in 2020.  The instrument concept is based on human vision, which can deduce roughly 10 million colors from the signals extracted from just three types of light-sensitive cones that have overlapping sensitivity to measure color combinations. The proposed solution uses the same architecture, replacing multiple instruments with a single device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will advance the translation of an algorithmic spectroscopy tool. Utilizing newly available thermal emitter technology with tunable center emission frequency across the infrared (2-10 microns wavelength), the program will demonstrate that spectroscopic information can be recovered algorithmically from a series of non-dispersive absorption measurements. The technology uses the human vision system as a model and pairs multiple emitters with overlapping emission spectra with low-cost, non-dispersive infrared detectors, such as thermopiles. The proposed solution will develop an algorithmic spectroscopy solution at a frequency range of 3800-2100 cm-1 by demonstrating sensitivity to the characteristic CO2 absorption bands and algorithmically reconstructing the CO2 spectrum. Successful completion of the proposed effort will establish the benchmarks for a new infrared spectroscopy technology that operates without costly dispersive elements or moving parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Measuring the spectral properties of materials in the infrared is a backbone of all fundamental sciences and sees widespread use throughout industry and academia. Diverse scientific fields ranging from biological and medical research, to material science and engineering rely on accurate measurements of infrared spectra. To date, there exists a single technology solution to gather this data, at a price point prohibitive to most small businesses, education and individuals.  In this project, Third Floor Materials and a team at Vanderbilt University developed and demonstrated a new way to asses infrared spectra and perform infrared absorption measurements. By combining a series of patented infrared light sources, characterized by their engineered emission spectrum with a simple infrared detector, the team demonstrated how software algorithms can be used to recover the spectral information of an object illuminated by these emitters.  The team designed and manufactured the light sources and combined them into an apparatus capable of measuring the infrared properties of a target gas. Depending on the algorithm used, the data extracted reveals the concentration of the gas present, or the characteristic infrared spectrum, which describes the exact infrared wavelengths (or "colors") that interact with the gas molecules and can be used to identify the gas. Both modes were demonstrated by using calibrated concentrations of carbon dioxide gas. Together, these data allowed for a complete qualitative and quantitative analysis of the gaseous sample.  The flexible measurement is enabled by the extensive use of computation to off-load tasks previously enabled by hardware into software, such as the interferometer to encode spectral data. The resulting combination of no needed moving parts and relaxed requirements for precise optical components and control, results in a spectrometer platform that can be realized at a fraction of the cost of the established interferometry-based technology.  Lowering the cost-barrier of access to infrared spectroscopy will have significant impact on education and small businesses by democratizing the access to a powerful tool of scientific discovery.
