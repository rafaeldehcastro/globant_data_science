<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be the development and commercialization of a new highly sensitive technology for vapor sensing.  This technology offers several advantages, including low power draw and high sensitivity, which allows for its integration in a range of persistent, wireless, portable, and autonomous monitoring applications.  These vapor sensors are anticipated to have application to a wide range of fields including agriculture, threat detection, health, indoor air quality, analysis of pollutants, and industrial chemical safety.  The developed technology is further expected to impact a range of fields leading to significant improvements in the quality of agricultural products, public health and safety, the efficiency of indoor climate control, and a broad range of medical technologies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a high sensitivity, microfabricated mass sensor functionalized with advanced sensor materials&lt;br/&gt;to create low-cost, low-power vapor sensing system. The proposed architecture fabricates a high frequency bulk acoustic resonator directly on the back-end of a Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductors (CMOS)-Integrated Chip (IC), which further improves the noise characteristics of the&lt;br/&gt;sensor.  The direct integration approach proposed simplifies the architecture for bulk acoustic wave vapor sensors, allows for less noise, and reduces the parasitics present in the structure. The direct co-integration also allows for the fabrication of an array of mass sensors that permits the creation of an electronic nose, in which the response to multiple receptors can be used to classify vapor materials and reduce the effect of nonspecific responses. The silicon IC also may compensate for thermal drift, further improving the noise floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program was proposed to examine the market potential for a new concept in vapor sensing, in which piezoelectric layers deposited directly on CMOS circuitry provides an integrated structure in which the high frequency of the resonator formed (2GHz+) provides an advantage over other sensors which use mass measurement for this application.  A student and a post-doc were involved in the program.  They were trained in the I-CORPS principles, and are now well positioned to lead the new company in its initial phase of operation.  Following the program, the two participants founded a company (Lelantos), and began fundraising to support further activities.   The program validated the business and technology thesis initially presented for the program. It was also discovered that this technology potentially has application to a number of other areas (energy production, safety, animal testing) and opportunities for further development in these areas is being explored.   The I-Corps program allowed for the identification and qualification of a number of customers and potential partners. Lelantos is now working on demonstrating the technologies of the program in a few specific applications, focusing on methane and hazardous gas detection.  Lelantos has also been in contact with a number of accelerators (and was accepted to Silicon Catalyst), investors, and other programs looking to further develop technologies in the vapor sensing space.
