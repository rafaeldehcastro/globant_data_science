<AbstractNarration>This award funds research in economic theory, with a focus on coordination games. This theory can be used to analyze a wide variety of economic problems, including financial crises and business cycles. While the standard coordination game approach offers insight into these settings, it allows multiple equilibria and thus does not offer a complete theory in the absence of a theory of equilibrium selection. In response, a global games approach has been widely used in applied economics. By assuming noisy information about payoffs, one can remove the multiplicity of equilibria and develop a wide variety of predictions that can then be tested against data. However, there are a number of important limitations to the global games approach. The four components of this research proposal address four different limitations. The components are relevant for all global game applications, but are developed in the context of applications in macroeconomics, political economy and finance.  The project therefore contributes to developing new theories and methods that can help individuals, businesses, and policymakers at all levels of government make better decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global game analysis has made extreme informational assumptions: there is common knowledge of payoffs and multiple equilibria, or small noise and globally unique equilibria. The project has four components, each designed to address one aspect of these assumptions. The first component examines richer classes of information structures to develop novel predictions about when global game predictions arise. Global game analysis has been primarily static. The second component examines dynamic environments with learning to develop predictions about when global game predictions occur. Global game analysis has focused on binary action games. The third component analyzes a political economy application where feasible set of available actions is itself a choice variable, and characterizes when the action set is or is not binary. Global game analysis has mostly relied on simple analytic solutions to deliver qualitative insights. The fourth component develops a finance application with a rich set of heterogeneous players in order to develop quantitative framework that that can be used in empirical work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Global games are an analytic tool used to analyze how coordination problems are resolved based on individuals' strategic uncertainty.  The project makes contributions on two dimensions.  This project has simultaneously developed techniques and used them in new applications.   Beliefs about others beliefs and higher-order beliefs are key to understanding all strategic settings, including coordination problem.  Global game analysis has highlighted the importance of "rank beliefs".  Suppose an individual has a certain expectation of random variables and beliefs about others' expectations.  His rank belief is his expectation of his rank among those expectations.  An outcome of the project as an analysis of the determinants of rank beliefs.  An important finding is that in any information structure, average rank beliefs are stochastically dominated by uniform (Laplacian) rank beliefs.  Morever, large shocks to the economic will move rank beliefs closer to uniform rank beliefs.  An implication is that equilibrium outomes will move closer to strategically stable ("risk dominant") actions.  This work has inspired ongoing work collecting survey data on rank beliefs that can be matched with portfolio choices of financial market participants.     Global games are widely used in formal political science to model conflict.  But the focus of this literature in on binary choice problems, i.e., when citizens are choosing between joining a revolution or abstaining.  But a long tradition following Tilly in political science has highlight the importance of "repertoires of contentious actions", i.e., the fact there are many larger and smaller actions that might be taken in support of a revolution.  We have developed the tools to analyze conflict when there are many actions available, and thus extended the scope of formal models to address the (informal) political science literature.  In particular, we characterize when wider or narrower range of contentious activities are utilized.                  Last Modified: 12/30/2021       Submitted by: Stephen E Morris]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
