<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[NSF INCLUDES Planning Grant: Project ACCESS: Accessible Cyber Content Expanded through State Synergies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The growth of the United States STEM workforce is important to economic and global competitiveness. Developing STEM talent among all sectors of society is needed in order to reach these goals. This planning grant project will advance the use of accessible cyber education activities and build capacity for a national network of content creators, event leaders, state agencies, non-profits, educators, STEM professionals with disabilities, workforce development programs, manufacturers of accessible STEM equipment, and others to collaborate and broaden the participation of learners with disabilities in the STEM workforce. Partnering organizations will share accessible cyber education resources, promote professional development opportunities, and host virtual peer learning communities. The  overall goal of the project to strengthen and expand collaborations that promote accessible cyber education resources and activities to enhance the preparation of individuals with disabilities for STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use a communities of practice approach, which brings people together to learn with and from each other. Planning grant activities include collaboratively developing plans for implementing the infrastructure needed to support a large-scale network; engaging additional, strategic partners; and exploring opportunities to scale and sustain the use of accessible cyber education activities to prepare individuals with disabilities to participate in the STEM workforce. The project will also include continuing efforts to disseminate accessible content for use in informal learning environments and workforce development programs. Expected project outcomes are increased knowledge of accessible cyber education content and enhanced capacity for broadening the participation of individuals with disabilities in the U.S. STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF INCLUDES planning grant is funded by NSF Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES), a comprehensive national initiative to enhance U.S. leadership in discoveries and innovations by focusing on diversity, inclusion and broadening participation in STEM at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
