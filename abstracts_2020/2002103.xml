<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is made as part of the FY 2020 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist.  The title of the project for this fellowship to Pui Tung Choi is "Interplay between geometry, topology, and physics in science and engineering."  The host institution for the fellowship is Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is Jorn Dunkel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
