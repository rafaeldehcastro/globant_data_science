<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused two serious epidemics in humans (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) and the current COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV2). There is evidence suggesting that although these CoVs originated from bats, other mammals could have been intermediate hosts that transmitted the virus to humans. Research supported by this award will help to identify animal populations that are likely susceptible to the current pandemic CoV (SARS-CoV2) and could potentially act as viral reservoirs and initiate new disease outbreaks. Determining the animal receptors that enable SARS-CoV2 cell entry will benefit both human and animal health by directing future studies of CoV tropism. This knowledge will also focus surveillance efforts to species most likely involved in zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV2 and other CoVs. This proposal will train undergraduate research students in computational and laboratory skills during the proposed project.  Results from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, posted to shared data repositories, and also shared through social media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research supported by this award will employ computational modeling and empirical laboratory research to identify animal angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptors that confer susceptibility to SARS-CoV2. Researchers will test the hypothesis that certain amino acid residues in animal ACE2 are essential for coronavirus (CoV) spike protein interaction and cell entry. A computational pipeline will be developed to model and simulate the docking of the SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain to the ACE2 cell receptor from hundreds of divergent animal species. We will also empirically test the capacity of SARS-CoV2 spike protein to utilize ACE2 through heterologous expressions systems and in vitro cell culture studies. The research has the potential to identify a wide spectrum of animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV2. This will aid in the understanding of the relationship between ACE2 genotype and SARS-CoV2 cell entry and allow the prediction of ACE2 residues that are critical for determining CoV susceptibility.  This RAPID award is made by the Symbiosis, Defense, and Self-recognition Program in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project set out to determine whether SARS-CoV2, the causative agent of COVID-19, can enter the cells of different animal species. Given the large numbers of humans that have been infected with SARS-CoV2, it has emerged that humans can transmit the virus to certain species of domesticated and peri-domesticated animals. This process is referred to as reverse zoonosis. Our interdisciplinary group included scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, biophysics, and virology and a team of diverse undergraduate students that were mentored and trained in all aspects of the research project. The team began by collating a comprehensive database of all currently known animal genes for the cell surface receptor ACE2. This protein acts as the primary receptor that enables SARS-CoV2 cell entry by interacting with the viral spike (S) protein. Without this receptor a cell is practically immune to viral infection. We have now curated a database of 678 ACE2 gene sequences and have determined their divergence from human ACE2. Amino acid diversity among animal ACE2 gene sequences is high, although less so for residues directly interacting with the S protein, with 24% identity across all animals. With the curated list we have employed computational modeling to predict whether animal ACE2 proteins can interact with the S protein of SARS-CoV2. This has resulted in the creation of 678 molecular scale models of the interactions that occur between these proteins. To validate these computational predictions, we used a non-replicating virus that enters cells using the SARS-CoV S protein to measure successful use of different animal ACE2 proteins. Focusing on ACE2 from rodent species that are important for spreading human diseases, we have tested their capacity to enable cell entry of SARS-CoV2. This approach has identified rodent species that are predicted to be susceptible to SARS-CoV2 with the potential of harboring the disease as an animal reservoir. All the data for this project is to be deposited on a user-friendly website that can be accessed to identify animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV2, their geographical locations, ACE2 sequences, and 3D models of the interactions between ACE2 and S protein. This will provide a valuable resource for scientists studying SARS-CoV2 and an educational resource for the public.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/13/2021<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;A&nbsp;Rowley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
