<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The coronavirus pandemic provides a rare opportunity to study public risk perceptions and risk-related behaviors in the midst of a World Health Organization Public Health Emergency of International Concern that could threaten the quality of life of a wide spectrum of Americans. Few emergencies within the United States have affected so many people. The situation is a rich opportunity because it is occurring in real-time and is highly dynamic, involving many players in our country and around the world. As a result, it allows the research team a chance to compare this health threat with other perceived disasters such as immigration, terrorism, and possible future public health emergencies. The public’s perceptions and risk-related behaviors seem likely to change over time in response to media coverage as well as actions from our own and foreign governments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one longitudinal study, the research team invites participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk to complete one survey each month for 5 months. The researchers query their risk perceptions and affective responses toward the coronavirus, frequency of discussions about the coronavirus with others, behavioral intentions towards hypothetical experimental vaccines and treatments, and support for possible policy solutions such as quarantine. The research also ascertains their intended travel plans and media exposure to the pandemic including how much they trust those sources. The team models the emotional, risk-perception, and behavioral responses of participants toward the coronavirus by using a latent variable growth curve model that examines the trajectories of variables over time. To establish causal links, the scholars also conduct a second related experiment that manipulates affect through narratives and examines its effects on risk perceptions, medical decisions, and policy decisions. Participants are assigned to a more negative or less negative condition, and mediation analysis is used to evaluate the manipulation’s effects. In these studies, theoretical links are made between risk perceptions, social amplification of risk, the affect heuristic and other functions of affect, and numeracy. There is a dynamic test of the three functions of affect by correlating current feelings over time with risk judgments, intended prevention and treatment behaviors, and support for policy options. Theoretical research on affect has not been tested in the setting of a world health emergency. This research results in deep mechanistic understanding of how emotions and media exposure influence vaccine and treatment choices as well as support for policies. Finally, the second study establishes causal links between affect and support for prevention, treatment, and policy strategies. The research tests the dynamic and causal power of the functions of affect and motivated reasoning in order to lay the groundwork for interventions for emotional responses to the coronavirus and future epidemics. The research also has important implications, including for communication methods, for other affect-rich decisions faced by the public and policy makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>One of the historical and central challenges of risk perception research has been the difficulty of examining how people?s attitudes and behavior in real-time emergencies change over time. We proposed to study how people perceive and react to the COVID-19 crisis, what information they attend to, who they trust (or do not trust), and how this crisis affects future plans, choices of preventive and treatment options, and support for policy options.</p> <p>&nbsp;We tracked a panel of 1,284 respondents from late February 2020 to December 2020. Across six waves of data collection, we measured affective (emotional) responses to the epidemic, perceptions of risk, and risk-related decisions and behaviors, including support for policies. We also conducted an experiment (described later) to test whether affect towards disease had causal effects on low-value treatment choices.</p> <p>Six main findings emerged.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Trust in doctors and scientists.</strong> Doctors and clinicians, scientists, and the CDC were consistently trusted by most of our sample from March to December. In contrast, President Trump, the news media, and the American public were distrusted by the majority of our sample (Figure 1). Thus, most people still trust doctors and scientists, who are critical sources of public health information.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Political polarization. </strong>We documented worrying impacts of political ideology on risk perceptions and negative affect (Figure 2). Conservatives also were more likely than liberals to endorse anti-Chinese conspiracies and to dehumanize Asians and Asian Americans, while being less likely to take protective behaviors.</li> <li><strong>Motivated verbal ability&nbsp;</strong><strong>rather than motivated numeracy.</strong> Political polarization was shown more by people with higher than lower verbal ability (controlling for numeric ability) as indicated by their affect and perceived risk concerning COVID-19 and policy attitudes. This result was surprising because prior work, including in our lab, implicated numeric ability as potentially the cause of greater polarization. These latest findings may explain why some researchers have not replicated previous motivated numeracy findings?it was verbal ability rather than numeric ability that was more likely to predict increased polarization. However, those higher in verbal ability were better, however, than those lower at rejecting misinformation. People higher in ability may have become more polarized because of their consumption of partisan news media (e.g., conservative Fox News vs. liberal New York Times) and interpretation of COVID-relevant information (Figure 3). Thus, providing more information will not necessarily reduce polarization, because higher-ability people may interpret it to preserve their current beliefs.</li> <li><strong>Affect may drive COVID-19 reactions. </strong>We also documented longitudinal evidence for multiple functions of affect?negative affect in self-report and text analysis of participant writing samples about coronavirus?being associated with greater perceived risk (affect as information), more attention toward news about the pandemic (affect as a spotlight), and more support for protective behaviors and policies (affect as a motivator of behavior).</li> <li><strong>Affect-motivated choosing. </strong>We also conducted an experiment to test whether affect might cause these effects. However, instead of conducting the experiment with COVID-19?due to concerns about whether we could alter affect towards COVID-19 and if it was ethical given that we expected it to change subsequent behavior?we tested our hypotheses in the context of an uncommon disease-causing microbe, <em>Naegleria fowleri,</em>(colloquially referred to as the brain-eating amoeba). We randomly assigned participants to receive information that would increase or decrease their negative affect towards the microbe. Participants in the greater-negative-affect condition subsequently reported more positive affect towards a drug that could treat the disease than those in the lower-negative-affect condition. Critically, they were more interested in and optimistic about using the drug to <em>prevent</em> the disease (which it is not designed to do). Our findings imply that fear of COVID-19 may have contributed to interest in low-value treatments and preventatives (e.g., ivermectin).</li> <li><strong>Providing numeric likelihoods and offering choice encourages vaccine interest. </strong>In a series of studies, we demonstrated that providing information about multiple brands of vaccines reduced intentions to vaccinate if participants were not allowed to choose their preferred vaccine. We further questioned in a separate study the costs of standard practice?not providing numeric likelihood information about vaccine side effects. Providing those numbers (e.g., ?7% experienced fever?) increased comprehension and vaccination intentions. Furthermore, giving people both numeric likelihoods and interpretative labels (e.g., ?common?) particularly increased vaccine intentions among vaccine-hesitant people (Figure 4).</li> </ol> <p>Altogether, our research has contributed to the scientific understanding of how people responded to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and how public health officials can communicate to better encourage self-protective behaviors, such as vaccines.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/25/2022<br>      Modified by: Ellen&nbsp;Peters</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653424701458_figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653424701458_figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653424701458_figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We asked participants to indicate ?How does the coronavirus make you feel?? on a scale from 1 = ?does not apply/describe? to 4&#8239;=&#8239;?completely describes? for afraid, worried, and upset, and averaged those ratings into a negative affect index.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brittany Shoots-Reinhard</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ellen&nbsp;Peters</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653425176003_figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653425176003_figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653425176003_figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Liberal vs. conservative news consumption (left) and interpretation of information (right) was more polarized for the top vs. bottom third of verbal ability in our sample.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brittany Shoots-Reinhard</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ellen&nbsp;Peters</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653426413835_figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653426413835_figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653426413835_figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We asked participants how likely they were to receive the hypothetical vaccine they read about on a scale from 1= �not likely� to 6 = �extremely likely.�</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brittany Shoots-Reinhard</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ellen&nbsp;Peters</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653424611153_figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653424611153_figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2022478/2022478_10658705_1653424611153_figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Percent of sample with moderately or extremely high trust in public figures/organizations to reduce the risk of COVID-19.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Bernardo Pohl Duarte</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ellen&nbsp;Peters</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
