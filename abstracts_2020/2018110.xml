<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Given the proliferation of wireless devices, sensors, and computers in our world, the efficient utilization of the electromagnetic spectrum is of paramount importance.  This project will support the acquisition of a continuous-wave characterization instrument at Oklahoma State University (OSU) to address the well-known and longstanding gap in electromagnetics and communications research of the utilization of millimeter-waves and terahertz frequency waves. The MRI instrument offers unique capabilities that have the potential to tackle the fundamental research problems blocking the development of high-performance communication, sensing, and imaging technologies.  The MRI instrument will enable research on the fundamental physics behind novel magnetic materials which could speed up computer memory and produce more power-efficient architectures.  It  also has the potential to bring new ideas on next-generation wireless communication studies that may advance the current state-of-the-art in terms of speed and data capacity for air-to-air and air-to-ground communications with unmanned aerial vehicles.  Finally, it will likely advance the field of compact imaging systems, providing a means of developing new machine vision techniques that work when radar, visible, and thermal infrared do not.  Apart from these technological benefits, the instrument will enable unique educational opportunities for the next generation of engineers and scientists, including training and outreach opportunities for high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students, teachers, and scientists through the OK-LSAMP (OK Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation), the OSU National Lab Day, and the OSU Summer Bridge programs. The instrument will also underpin new lab modules in communication and microwave classes at OSU. Technology transfer and research progress based on the MRI instrument will be enhanced by a volunteer advisory committee consisting of the PIs and industry and university experts.&lt;br/&gt;The MRI characterization instrument will enable  narrowband transmission/reflection measurements and wideband, arbitrary waveform measurements in the 0.11-0.50 THz range with sub-500 kHz frequency resolution and 120 dB dynamic range.    Specific goals include the use of the instrument to develop research contributions in the following areas:&lt;br/&gt;• Development of artificial materials with high quality factor electromagnetic responses based on anapole and bound-in-the-continuum concepts.  These will be experimentally explored with high frequency resolution leading to new and high-performance designs of mm-wave and terahertz chem/bio sensors.&lt;br/&gt;• The physics of high frequency quasiparticle dynamics in chiral and anti-ferromagnetic materials, spin-Hall auto-oscillators, and resonance spin-wave spectroscopy.  These studies will advance fundamental understanding of quantum materials and lead to faster and more power efficient computing architectures. &lt;br/&gt;• Propagation channel emulators for 5G and beyond wireless communications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).  These studies will provide new empirical channel models, providing the engineering foundation for UAV-based communication networks in unpredictable environmental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;• Realtime behaviors of multichannel transmitters and active radar transceiver arrays.  These measurements will validate the improved performance, efficiency, and reliability of mm-wave integrated circuits for high-bandwidth communications and active imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be set up for a variety of different measurement types by leveraging the existing millimeter-wave and terahertz infrastructure at Oklahoma State University and made available to both internal and external users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project resulted in numerous and continuing outcomes aligned with the intellectual merit and broader impacts originally proposed.  We review the fundamental motivation that scientific research utilizing millimeter wave and terahertz frequencies is rapidly accelerating as demand grows for faster wireless communications, better sensing and imaging methodologies, and the search for novel materials that enhance the performance and efficiency of electrical technologies.  This equipment grant was intended to provide a characterization platform, nicknamed TWISTER, to support all such endeavors, particularly around the region of Oklahoma and surrounding states.    The broader impacts of the project have been a strong success.  For one, the TWISTER instrument has attracted internal users from several groups within Oklahoma State University (OSU) and also external users from the University of Texas &ndash; Dallas (UT-Dallas) and industrial researchers from Riverside Research, in Beaver Creek, OH, validating its one-of-a-kind capabilities in our region.   The work has most directly addressed the important societal interest of enabling faster, more economical, and more efficient, next-generation wireless communication.  At OSU, the TWISTER instrument has impacted or thoroughly underpinned the experimental work behind 5 Ph.D. students and 3 Masters students in electrical engineering.  In addition, the grant has supported the research of 3 undergraduate students directly, via the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), and several others tangentially. One of these students was part of the OK-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, while another (female) student has since decided to pursue graduate studies.  The grant also strongly supported the research endeavors of 5 faculty members directly.  Notably, this resulted in multiplicative growth wherein TWISTER-generated research outcomes ultimately resulted in additional funding in excess of $1.5M.  This has positioned OSU very favorably to continue competitive research endeavors in the foreseeable future.     In terms of intellectual merit, the work enabled by this project has resulted in both fundamental and practical research advancements.  External users from UT-Dallas used TWISTER to validate the design and performance of a novel type of signal modulator for millimeter-wave communication systems.  External users from Riverside Research successfully demonstrated un-impaired high speed wireless communication through a novel beam steering device based on artificial dielectrics, a possibly important step toward deploying practical millimeter wave communication systems of the future.  The UT-Dallas work was recently submitted to an internationally renowned conference while the Riverside work has been published in Nature &ndash; Scientific Reports.  OSU users have employed TWISTER to demonstrate long-distance, wide bandwidth communications at sub-terahertz frequencies, setting the foundation for important studies of wave propagation through the atmosphere.  In like manner, similar measurements were performed to prove the validity of an OSU-generated communication model that incorporates dispersion effects not present in earlier-generation wireless systems.  We expect this will be an important addition to engineering models upon which 6G wireless systems will be designed in the future.  This is particularly true for terahertz wireless backhaul, which is a likely candidate for the first realizable 6G systems.     In terms of additional intellectual merit, the project enabled the support of two other important research endeavors.  The first was an OSU-led NASA initiative to investigate hybrid radio-frequency and free-space optical (or RF/FSO) communication.  The reported project provided the experimental foundation for collecting real-world FSO by which machine learning methods could be used in place of more complex and dedicated signal processing hardware.  This could be an important step forward for the NASA project goal of enhancing networking and reliability in future NASA lunar missions.  The second is an ongoing initiative to explore the realizability of high-performance, multifunctional flat optics based on metamaterials in the terahertz regime.  The reported project underpinned the experimental facilities necessary to measure such devices accurately and determine their real-world benefit in future communication and remote sensing systems.
