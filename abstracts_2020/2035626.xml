<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this SBIR Phase 1 project will be in significant reduction of food waste.  Food waste is a critically important global challenge. Approximately 30% of food produced for human consumption around the world is either lost or wasted each year â€“ more than enough to feed the hungry.  It is estimated that food loss and waste also contribute 8% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions. The methods used to reduce waste by extending shelf life are not only ineffective, but they also exacerbate other global problems, such as adversely impacting the environment through extensive use of plastic packaging. The proposed solution uses non-GMO corn to create new edible coatings that will reduce food waste by doubling the shelf life of whole and cut fresh fruits and vegetables, enabling greater access to fresh foods for all communities and improving the environmental impact of food waste. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance translation for a process using corn zein, considered a water insoluble protein and therefore prohibitively expensive to functionalize in food production. This has prevented its use in food coatings. This project advances translation of a relatively simple process to convert commercial grade zein to a readily water-soluble formulation. The project will develop an effective edible food coating that incorporates other plant-based ingredients, such as fatty acids and plasticizers, to create a hybrid protein/lipid film that (1) exhibits excellent gas barrier as well as moisture barrier properties and extends the shelf life of many under-served commodities; (2) can be generated at reasonable cost; and (3) can be delivered in a single application on existing food processing equipment. The R&amp;D plan will target coatings for a variety of fresh produce that allows comparison with competitive coatings where possible, and provides new coating options where few options are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
