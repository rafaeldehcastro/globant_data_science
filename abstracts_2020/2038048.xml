<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The 21st International Symposium on Aviation Psychology (ISAP) is scheduled to take place May 18-21, 2021, in Portland, OR. ISAP showcases cutting-edge research on human cognition and performance, fosters collaboration between researchers and operators, and envisions and empirically tests design solutions that match aviation technology to human capabilities. The symposium encourages researchers to focus basic research on applied needs. It is founded on the idea that meaningful interactions between basic researchers and front-line practitioners are necessary to advance knowledge and turn it to society’s benefit. Although aerospace is the focus of ISAP, the meeting’s interest in the basic science of human performance encourages cross-fertilization with other areas of application, including medicine, ground transportation, and military command and control. The knowledge generated therefore is not limited to aviation applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics of interest at ISAP include human-system integration, display design, training and simulation, human interaction with autonomous systems, personnel selection, and sociotechnical system effectiveness, all as applied within systems on the ground, in the air, and in space. In plenary panel sessions, practitioners (e.g., pilots, air traffic controllers, maintenance personnel) present the critical safety issues that they face, and researchers present the latest scientific and technological approaches to achieving solutions. Three additional plenary sessions feature invited speakers, selected to represent a breadth of scientific disciplines and topics pertinent to aviation. Over the course of the symposium, researchers have the opportunity to present their latest scientific, engineering, or methodological work in either a spoken or a poster session. ISAP also places a special emphasis on fostering student involvement by conducting a Best Student Paper Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Symposium on Aviation Psychology (ISAP) is a biennial conference that brings researchers and engineers together with pilots, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance workers, and other aviation industry personnel. The symposium aims to create a safer and more efficient airspace by applying the findings of basic psychology and cognitive neuroscience to aviation systems. The research showcased helps designers and managers:  build technology that lets frontline aviation personnel perform their jobs safely, efficiently, and effectively, and  select and train human operators as well as possible for their roles.   By establishing design principles on fundamental knowledge of performance and cognition, the research presented at ISAP also brings benefit to domains of application beyond aviation, including medicine, driving, and defense.  The 21st ISAP was held online, May 18-21, 2021, and drew 237 attendees from 31 countries. International attendees comprised 34% of registrants, and 32% of attendees were students. Non-student attendees represented the academic, government, and industry sectors.  Presentations at the 2021 ISAP covered themes including  Advanced Air Mobility;  Airspace and Air Traffic Management;  Aviation Interface Design;  Education;  Exploring Methods to Collect and Analyze Human Contributions to Safety;  Human-Machine Teaming;  Organizational Safety and Culture;  Selection of Air Traffic Controllers and Pilots;  Skills Degradation and Assessment;  Skills Training;  Teamwork and Multiteam Coordination; and,  Weather Hazards Affecting General Aviation Safety.    Other meeting sessions included a Best Student Paper Competition, discussion panels of aviation practitioners and researchers, and keynote talks on cognitive neuroscience for aviation and on human-machine teaming.
