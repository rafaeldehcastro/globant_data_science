<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Scientific approaches relying on big data and on large data transfers require unique cyberinfrastructure, called Science DMZs, to support fast and easy data transfers and access of data. Typically, the benefits of these complicated Science DMZs have accrued to large, well-resourced “Research-Intensive” institutions, which compounds an already growing disparity between large and small institutions, especially often-lesser-resourced minority serving institutions. This also makes it much more difficult for smaller institutions with a primarily instructional mission to expand existing research and expose students to scientific approaches or collaborations, including those that may rely on big data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a partnership between Duke University, North Carolina Central University, Davidson College, and MCNC (NC’s regional research and education network provider), this project plans the creation of a shared Science DMZ (sS-DMZ) as a service of the North Carolina Research and Education Network so that lesser-resourced institutions do not have to bear all setup and maintenance costs and can instead commit their resources to local infrastructure, their scientific researchers and pursuit of new research grants. This project works with regional higher-ed institutions to 1) establish community trust and shared governance responsibility necessary to expand participation in a sS DMZ program and 2) architect the approach to build the technical solution of operating a sS-DMZ. The resulting proposal will also inform the feasibility of a sSDMZ in other Research and Education Networks in the United States as an approach to reduce overall costs while increasing access to Big Data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This planning grant supported the efforts of a team from North Carolina Central University, Davidson College, MCNC, and Duke University to develop two proposals to the 2021 Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC* 21-528) solicitation. The vision motivating both proposals was to reach and support a diverse community of researchers and students in North Carolina by designing simple to use, secure, and reliable scientific computational tools that can improve the reach and effectiveness of research and STEM education in the state. The proposals were also effective in devising approaches for raising the level of security and reducing vulnerabilities by implementing a set of standard security best practices as centralized services that would be cost-effective and sustainable for lesser resourced institutions of higher education in the state.   One proposal advanced a shared science network (aka, a Science DMZ) that could enhance the speed and security of transfers of scientific data to and from researchers at the smaller participating institutions and with others in the larger scientific community. The other proposed creation of shared computational resources to enhance both research and educational offerings. Both types of resources proposed are already commonly available to faculty and their students at large research institutions, but the proposals focused on methods for reducing the cost and complexity to administer these resources as shared services available to smaller institutions. The result was a design and approach more attainable at HBCUs, liberal arts colleges and other small and mid-sized colleges and universities in the state.  Through the planning effort, the team engaged with more than 120 faculty from eight colleges and universities to develop science drivers that would be supported and enhanced by each of the two proposals. Notable outcomes included:   Increased collaboration among and across institutions, which deepened relationships for future endeavors and collaborations. The sharing and gaining of knowledge regarding the design of a technical architecture that would also deliver the envisioned capabilities arising from a cybersecurity professional community of interest across institutions.  Participants became better equipped to develop future NSF grant proposals through exposure to the fundamentals and elements of the cyberinfrastructure plan development process, a requirement of certain NSF grant proposals.   The project also resulted in identification of implementation plans, schedules and equipment needs for two pilot schools, work to qualify technical approaches for each of the other prospective participants (beyond the two pilot schools) and identifying an industry-standard provider for authentication support tools that will be required by some prospective participants. The qualification of technical approaches for prospective schools included determining which of two different architectural approach worked best based on network connection characteristics.  The result of the collective body of planning work grounded important IT support approaches and collaboration targets for scientific research conducted by the institutions' faculty, staff, and students.
