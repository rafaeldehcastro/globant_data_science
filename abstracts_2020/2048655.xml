<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[What factors are most formative in the development of environmental stewardship, and how do they vary across different cultural and environmental contexts? This doctoral dissertation project seeks to investigate variation in understandings of the natural environment and how these understandings shape conservation efforts. The project, which trains a graduate student in methods of empirical, ethnographic data collection and analysis, uses cutting-edge anthropological methods and theory to shed light on underlying cognitive processes driving shared understandings of environmental resources. The findings of this research will be disseminated broadly to academic and non-academic audiences, including NGOs and stakeholders in environmental stewardship. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this research asks whether different modes of engagement with marine environments reflect different moral attitudes about human activity and the natural world, and whether such moral attitudes inform conservation-relevant decision making. The work is situated in a marine recreation context that, like many others, is also highly climate-vulnerable, posing a common dilemma of balancing exploitation against conservation to preserve recreational activities. The investigators use cultural consensus analysis and ethnographic methods to explore variation in what is considered morally acceptable, as well as how this morality informs the way individuals navigate ethical dilemmas. The research will contribute to a broader, nuanced understanding of environmental morality as a driver influencing behavior in socio-environmental systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Engaging with literature in anthropology and behavioral studies of recreational fishers, this study employed systematic ethnographic research methods to address three overarching questions: (1) What understandings of the world underlie CHES anglers? recreational fishing practices, and to what extent are these understandings shared among anglers? (2) What variation in such understandings exists, and how is it socially distributed? (3) How do these differences relate to variation in behavior and ethical deliberation? Results indicate that a strongly shared cultural model of recreational fishing morality exists despite numerous axes of variation among CHES anglers, though there are a small number of key intra-cultural differences across sub-groups in the sample. Further, responses to ethnographically informed ethical dilemma prompts show systematic variation based on age, and to a lesser degree, individual knowledge of the shared cognitive model of recreational fishing morality. This project is significant because it explores the underlying psychosocial processes that mediate human interaction with the natural world. Attentiveness to such processes is vital for understanding not only the behavior of recreational anglers, but human interactions with the environment more broadly.
