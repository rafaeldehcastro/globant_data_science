<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award supports the participation of U.S.-based researchers in the program "Minimal surfaces and geometric flows,'' co-organized by the principal investigator, to be held January 18-29, 2021 at the Matrix Institute, located on the University of Melbourne's Creswick campus, Victoria, Australia. The first week of the event offers two minicourses in the style of a winter school aimed at junior researchers. The second week is focused on research seminars in the style of a conference, with junior and senior researchers presenting their research. An emphasis is put on the interaction between experts in the area and training opportunities for young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program aims to bring together mathematicians from different countries that are currently working on classical and nonlocal geometric problems, with special interest in the study of classification and regularity results for classical and nonlocal minimal surfaces, problems related to spectral analysis of elliptic problems of geometric interest, maximum principles, oscillation theorems, and existence and qualitative properties of solutions to classical and nonlocal geometric flows. The first week consists of minicourses in which junior participants receive a state-of-the-art introduction to this emerging field, with an emphasis on interaction and discussion. During the second week, senior and junior participants will present the latest developments in these areas of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/events/pminimal-surfaces-and-geometric-flows-interaction-between-the-local-and-the-nonlocal-worlds/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
