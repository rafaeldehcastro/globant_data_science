<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The 311 systems that city officials currently deploy can efficiently help agencies detect non-emergency civic issues such as potholes and trash on the streets. Although the 311 system was designed for non-emergency calls, residents can re-appropriate the technology for capacities not initially intended. For example, when Hurricane Irma hit Miami in 2017, residents used 311 systems to report disaster-related problems, leading city officials to adapt the system and create a new category for calls. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of civic infrastructures that range from reduced public transportation systems and public libraries' closure. If managed well, local governments and publics can co-produce effective civic technology that addresses pandemic-related issues and promotes quality services. Because it is still unclear how local governments balance between managerial efficiency and citizen empowerment through 311 systems, the project team aims to understand how people use the system, how local governments support people's different uses of the system, and how the different performance metrics of local governments for 311 systems function at the metropolitan area level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      In the planning phase supported by this award, the project team is establishing connections with local governments in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area (a.k.a., DMV area) through roundtables organized by a community partner, Connected DMV, and is consolidating currently-inconsistent 311 datasets as a viable unified database. If Stage 1 is successful, the project team will integrate local governments' performance metrics by analyzing their 311 datasets and survey city officials. Based on the survey, the team will build a web-based visualization tool that shows metropolitan-level system performance during the pandemic. These tools and metrics will directly impact governments' service quality, system design adjustment processes, and citizens' awareness of communication processes. This research will also educate undergraduate and graduate students about data science and its social implications, particularly regarding marginalized communities less represented in the 311 systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, many local governments implemented different strategies to take reports from their residents using technologies. For example, Washington D.C. created new categories in their 311 systems (i.e., the unified phone number to report any non-emergency civic issues) such as "violation of mask mandates," so residents can report such issues when identified. However, such technological strategies and policies varied significantly within metropolitan areas because each local government had a high autonomy in dealing with its own civic issues. Although this may not be a significant problem in normal times, it could make it hard to allocate resources efficiently when there is a need for regional response to a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Small jurisdictions that do not have enough resources have a hard time leveraging technology to manage public issues. Also, they have difficulty learning the best practices because there are limited channels to communicate strategies across local jurisdictions. This led us to design a civic tech playbook that multiple jurisdictions can use as a communication tool. The effectiveness of the civic tech playbook can be achieved only when we understand the different strategies of local jurisdictions, their common issues, and residents' responses to technological changes. To make the civic tech playbook a viable resource for local jurisdictions, our project team started with partnerships with local jurisdictions in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area through multiple 1-on-1 sessions. Also, because jurisdictions managed non-emergency civic issues differently, we developed a data processing pipeline that consolidates different types of reports as a unified dataset. Based on data-level technologies and partnerships that we achieved during the planning phase, in the subsequent phases, we aim to design the civic tech playbook as a key communication tool for local jurisdictions to better respond to future crises as a region (rather than by themselves) while maintaining their autonomy.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2021<br>      Modified by: Myeong&nbsp;Lee</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
