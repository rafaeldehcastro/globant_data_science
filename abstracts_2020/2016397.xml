<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This planning grant will develop a shared vision and the partnerships required for an innovative research infrastructure that includes not only a computer system but also a community of users, for the development of new forms of recommender system applied to online news.  There are three key broader impacts for this planning grant, and the subsequent infrastructure based on the plan. First, news recommendation has clear societal importance. Organizing the research community to support work on diversity, transparency, credibility, and effective news recommendation is a benefit not only for research, but for society. Second, the planned infrastructure has the potential to benefit not only the core research communities targeted, but also other research communities across the nation and around the world, including those in journalism and mass communication. Third, the planning process will engage a diverse set of researchers, including many from areas traditionally underserved, to extend the impact of this work as far as possible.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The design, construction, and governance of this infrastructure has significant research challenges.  In this case, the system is a news recommender application (plus the back-end to support it) and the users will be people who read news through the application. The infrastructure also includes experimental controls to allow researchers to run experiments by varying the recommendation algorithms and interfaces of the application and measuring results.  Such infrastructure can reinvigorate research in recommender systems by enabling new applications, study designs, and success metrics. Central to this project is a series of outreach activities and planning meetings for the community. These range from a broad survey and a community forum for 100 researchers (held in conjunction with a conference) to smaller meetings of intended users and partners in implementation. These meetings will identify community needs and priorities, design both the infrastructure itself and the governance models needed to operate it, and develop models to ensure sustainability.   This planning effort will engage a diverse subset of the research community in deep and thoughtful discussions about what research we are unable to carry out in academic settings today, what research we value, and what infrastructure we need to advance research in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Experimental research on recommender systems is challenging, especially for those in academia who lack access to manipulate real-world systems.  As a result, we've seen that fewer academic researchers are testing their ideas experimentally, preferring to simply validate their ideas on existing datasets.  The drawback of this approach is that existing datasets cannot replicate the complexity of real recommendation--of introducing users or customers to new products and information they have not previously experienced.  One significant problem this approach has led to is over-focusing recommender systems on "discovering" what users did on their own anyway rather that "recommending" new content users might not have found otherwise.   The goal of this work is to design and then eventually develop a shared research infrastructure that would allow researchers to carry out experiments (without the cost and burden of operating their own infrastructure).  This award supported an extensive planning effort that reached out to the recommender systems research community, but also researchers on natural language processing and experts in news, seeking their input on what would be needed for such an infrastructure to support their research questions.    The end result of this planning effort is a clear design for the infrastructure the community needs -- a design submitted to NSF's CCRI program for funding.  We identified partner news organizations (in particular the Associated Press) who agree to provide content.  We determined that there is value in initially creating a daily personalized newsletter with news article stubs (and links to the full articles) where the articles presented and presentation are under experimenter control.  We will then design a news site/app with the same type of experimental control.  Moreover, the system will have extensive user profiles, logging of user actions, and interactivity features including surveys and end-user controls.  An experimental framework will allow us to assign users to different experimental conditions and collect the relevant data for each expeirment for delivery to the researchers.    In total, this design, when implemented, will provide not only software and tools, but a community of users who've consented to participate in studies.  (An ethics kit and IRB instructions will be included in the researcher materials.)         Last Modified: 04/17/2023       Submitted by: Joseph A Konstan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
