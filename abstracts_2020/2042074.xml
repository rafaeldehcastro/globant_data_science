<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Non-technical Description of the Project&lt;br/&gt;In nearly every decision a person makes, they are required to combine multiple, sometimes conflicting sources information.  Thus, understanding how people use these multiple sources of information is fundamental to understanding and predicting choices.  Established approaches within psychology allow examination these processes in some situations. For example, to explore decision stages, a decision-maker may be asked to describe her thought process when making a choice, and that description is used to inform the researcher. In many situations, direct information about the choice processes is not accessible. For example, a decision maker may search her memory to find the information that could be used for choosing between options. When memory search is fast, people rarely have clear insight into how the memories were accessed and used. To allow for investigating decisions based on multiple sources of information across the widest range of situations, the principal investigators will integrate a powerful methodology based on mathematical cognitive modelling with standard decision-making research methodologies. The research will accomplish three objectives: (1) to gain an important understanding how multiple sources of information are combined during decision making, (2) conduct new empirical tests of the fundamental process across different decision making tasks, and (3) rigorously compare among the top decision making theories based on the new empirical findings.  These results will inform decision makers, allow assessment of decision making efficiency, and enable better models of choice behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Over the years, several decision making models were proposed that can account for many of the typical findings in human decision making, using both choice accuracy and response time output measures. However, no clear agreement about the underlying cognitive mechanism has been reached. These models can often be distinguished by strong implications about the processes that lead to a decision. Specifically, these models imply (a) how information is searched for, (b) when this information search is stopped, and (c) how the acquired information is integrated to reach the decision. Nonetheless, the disagreement remains.  In part this is due to model mimicking:  Without appropriate experimental design and analysis, different theories can make equivalent predictions. For example, inferences based on traditional mean response time (RT) analysis are limited due to model mimicking, as different decision-making models can imply exactly the same mean response time patterns. To overcome this limitation, we will integrate the powerful systems factorial technology (SFT) with traditional decision-making methods. SFT has been successfully applied in a wide range of perceptual and cognitive tasks to identify processing order, stopping rule and process dependency (a, b, and c from above), but has only been applied to decision making in very limited way.  Our research will link SFT to the classical methods in judgment and decision making to improve our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying decision-making.  Our project will also contribute to improving the professional academic development of undergraduate and graduate students at two state universities that traditionally have fewer research opportunities for students.  All aspects of this research project, from methodology to theoretical development, will be communicated at national and international professional Furthermore, the research will be submitted for publication in high-quality, peer-reviewed journals. One of the aims of the proposed research is to disseminate the findings to a broader audience through our respective university press offices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The core goal of our research was to improve methodology for understanding the nature of human decision-making. We focused on how people combine multiple sources of information or multiple attributes to make a selection between choices when there is uncertainty in the outcome associated with those choices.  To address shortcomings of previous approaches, we adapted a theory driven methodological framework that had predominantly been applied to perceptual studies, systems factorial technology (SFT).  The template for our approach was to first identify candidate models for decision-making in a given scenario (examples of which are outlined below) and reframe the core properties of those models in terms of the SFT formalisms.  The second step was to identify critical empirical manipulations that would allow for discriminating among the candidate models.  The final steps of the process were to collect the data and analyze using both parametric model comparison techniques and non-parametric assessments defined within the SFT framework.  In support of that core goal, we applied this structure to paradigms that commonly appear in the decision-making literature.    The first general paradigm to which we applied our analysis was a collection of tasks grouped under the description of "probabilistic inference from givens." In these tasks, participants were asked to make a choice between two options where each option was different on one to three attributes and where those attributes were probabilistically associated with a negative outcome.  We primarily relied on a design in which participants were asked to determine which of two bugs was more likely dangerous based on its body, legs, and mandibles.  In the initial phase of the task participants learned the degree to which each of those features was associated with danger.  After they reached a learning criterion, they were then tested to either examine how they combined information across features or across the two bugs.  Across features, the majority of participants considered only a subset of the information before making a decision, regardless of whether the relative predictive strengths of the features encouraged that approach.  Among those participants, most considered the features sequentially, but some considered the features in parallel. Nearly all participants considered both bugs and most used that information at the same time for a decision.    In a related set of experiments we gave explicit information.  In one of these tasks, we gave participants a choice between two gambles that could vary based on the probability of winning and the magnitude of the potential win (or loss) associated with that probability.  For example, a participant could have been asked to choose either 1) Win 20 points with probability 0.6 or nothing with probability 0.4; or 2) Win 10pts with probability 1. Across the variations of this task, we found that most peoples’ performances are aligned with a heuristic decision-making strategy wherein each aspect is considered sequentially until an attribute distinguishes the choices, or a strategy in which both sources of information are considered at the same time, but still treated separately.  There was no evidence of people using pooled information across the aspects (predicted by an expected reward maximizing strategy).    The second category of tasks was "Probabilistic inference from memory." We adapted a paradigm from the decision making literature in which a participant must first learn about a series of potential suspects, then later make a decision about suspects’ likely guilt given a clue.  For example, the suspects may be distinguished by the color of shirt they wore and the size of bag they carried. We developed two versions of this task relying on similarity between the target suspect and other suspects along the two distinguishing dimensions.  In this task, it was uncommon for participants to demonstrate selective influence, hence participants were likely relying on a representation of the suspects that combined information across the dimensions for some part of the memory process rather than treating them separately.    There has been one paper published based on the work in this grant, another is currently under review and three more are in preparation.  The funding has also supported faculty, graduate student, and undergraduate student presentations at Annual Meetings of the Society for Mathematical Psychology and the Psychonomic Society.  Experimental software and analysis code that were developed have been shared and at least one experiment has been used as the foundation for extensive empirical studies undertaken by the US Air Force Research Laboratory.    The funding has supported two graduate women and five undergraduate women under the supervision of Dr. Houpt.  One of the graduate students completed her PhD while supported on the grant and is now a researcher with the US Navy.  Of the five undergraduate students, four were Hispanic.  At least one of them has since started graduate school and all five were employed in psychology related fields after the completion of work in Dr. Houpt’s lab.
