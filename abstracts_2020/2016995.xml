<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This workshop will bring together members of the established and emerging scientific community interested in seafloor deformation using geodetic tools deployed on the seafloor.  The workshop will offer the first opportunity to foster communications between scientists and engineers to explore how to utilize existing resources to maximize science goals.  Geodetic instruments can capture motions offshore that give us important insight into earthquakes and submarine volcanic activity.  The workshop is focused on seafloor deformation because ninety percent of Earth's active tectonic plate boundaries are underwater and our ability to measure the deformation that leads up to an earthquake is predominantly on-land, which doesnâ€™t capture most of the seafloor movement. This is particularly important along subduction zones, where tsunamis may be generated by the movement on a fault during an earthquake. The conference will include 90 participants. The timing of the conference is important because a new resource is being developed for the community, a set of seafloor geodetic instruments that can measure precise long-term horizontal and short-term vertical movements.  At the workshop, the community will discuss how to apply these resources to maximize science and accessibility of data, leading to proposals for future offshore projects.  The workshop will broaden participation in the field of seafloor geodesy and a significant number of the participants will be early career scientists. The workshop will offer an opportunity to foster connections between scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together and build the seafloor geodesy community, including scientists from academic institutions, government agencies, and international partners focused on understanding scientific and engineering problems associated with measuring deformation on the seafloor.  During the workshop the organizers will address the current status of existing, the development of emerging, and plans for future technologies in the field. As well, the workshop is essential to develop plans for the use of a recently funded pool of GNSS-Acoustic and Bottom Pressure Recorder seafloor geodetic instruments.  The workshop will identify high priority scientific questions and targets for this pool of instruments and the community preferred structure for managing the instrument pool. The community will help identify the highest priority scientific questions and targets addressable with the instrument pool and develop a plan for managing the equipment to effectively answer geophysical questions in earth deformation in the offshore environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The workshop had 165 registrants from 97 universities and research labs, 69 early-career scientists, 10 postdoctoral researchers, and 27 graduate students.  Most participants were from the US, however 20 countries were represented, including Canada, Chile, Germany, Japan, and New Zealand.

Given the relatively small size of the existing pool given community size, the overwhelming sentiment was that most instrumentation be made available for community experiments, with some left for individual or small-group PI-driven projects.

The "Workshop on the Alaska and Cascadia Seafloor Geodetic Community Experiment" was held in April 2022. Recommendations:  Aim to achieve four specific science goals: (1) understand variations in megathrust coupling along-strike, (2) identify megathrust locking very near the trench where tsunami earthquakes rupture, (3) characterize aseismic fault slip associated with earthquakes, and (4) constrain transient deformation following major earthquakes.  Deploy up to 12 Seafloor Geodesy Instrument Pool sensors at sites across the near-trench environments offshore Cascadia and Alaska. The consensus was for six to seven sites offshore Cascadia and five to six sites offshore Alaska.  Continue observations at existing GNSS-Acoustic sites along the Cascadia and Alaska.  Develop open-source GNSS-Acoustic processing algorithms.  Training courses are needed to focus on data collection.  Develop an apply-to-sail program for students and early-career scientists.  With international partners, the community needs to establish data standards for seafloor geodetic data.   The data collected through a community experiment should follow FAIR data principles and an open data policy.         Last Modified: 06/29/2023       Submitted by: Andrew V Newman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
