<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a new fetal monitor to accurately assess fetal health and the integrity of the uterine scar in the case where a woman has a previous C-section (operative) delivery. There are about 4 million births in the US annually. The fetal monitoring market is expected to reach approximately $3.6 billion in 2022. This project will advance translation of a monitor providing accurate data, improved maternal mobility, and better outcomes. Furthermore, the technology is envisioned to be disposable, reducing exposure to pathogen transmission - a benefit in particular during the pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project advances translation of a medical device that monitors the fetus and uterus during pregnancy, labor and delivery. Fetal monitors today are unreliable at providing consistent interpretive data of fetal well-being in utero and require constant readjustment to ensure consistent fetal tracing. This process is cumbersome and introduces dangerous errors, most often due to fetal, maternal and monitor movement. This process explores a wireless device generating valuable monitoring data in a consistent, thorough, hygienic, and efficient manner that is comfortable for the patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
