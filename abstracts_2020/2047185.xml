<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[While the Standard Model of particle physics stands as one of our most well-tested physical theories, it is expected to break down under certain conditions, and unexplained observational evidence and theoretical puzzles call for understanding of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Where and how this new physics originates are some of the biggest outstanding problems of physics; therefore testing the limits of the Standard Model is a primary goal of many high-profile experimental programs in nuclear physics. Such low-energy nuclear tests may be our only hope at discovery if the energy scale of new physics is beyond the reach of accelerators. Quantitative theoretical calculations of these processes are crucial for planning experiments, understanding their backgrounds, and connecting results to various BSM models. This research involves calculations supporting these high-impact nuclear experiments, utilizing some of the largest supercomputing facilities worldwide. Such calculations lead to advancements in high-performance computing, with repercussions for other computational fields.  New understanding of nuclear physics has close ties to national security and energy research, and students in the PI's collaboration have already begun careers in these sectors. The educational activities furthermore aim to provide research opportunities for under-represented students at the University of Costa Rica. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental theory behind nuclear interactions is known to be Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD, a numerical formulation, is currently our only known technique for performing QCD calculations relevant for nuclear systems such that theoretical uncertainties are fully quantifiable and errors may be systematically removed. This research will use lattice QCD to calculate single- and multi-hadron observables necessary for understanding experimental searches for new physics including: 1. Searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay, a proposed ultra-rare process which, if observed, would shed light on the origin of the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the Universe, as well as an understanding of the nature of neutrino masses. 2. Measurements of parity violation in hadronic systems, necessary for constraining the Standard Model, and being performed at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 3. Measurements of the neutron lifetime, which currently display experimental tension potentially pointing to new physics contributions. 4. Long baseline neutrino experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), which will probe CP violation and the neutrino mass hierarchy. 5. General low-energy fundamental symmetry tests involving nuclei as laboratories, to be understood and connected to underlying BSM physics via theoretical understanding of nucleon interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
