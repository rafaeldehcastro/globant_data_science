<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic is quickly making broad changes to American society.  This project surveys the public opinions, attitudes, and behaviors of thousands of Americans in order to map and track the social disruptions caused by the outbreak, economic shutdowns, and responding public policies.  The project will enhance understanding of (1) effectiveness of public policy in changing individual behavior to conform with public health recommendations; (2) the ways in which different forms of public communication create understanding about the pandemic and distribute public health recommendations; and (3) social and psychological stress caused by social distance and quarantine.  The rise of SARS, MERS, H1N1, and COVID-19 underline the need to understand these phenomena – not just the epidemiology of pandemics, but the effective social policies and practices that create positive behaviors and mitigate harms.  This will not be the last event of its kind, but with a thorough understanding of its effects, we can be better prepared for the next one. As such, the findings will inform governmental policies at several levels. It will also inform civic leaders and residents, thus helping all to mount efforts to mitigate pandemics’ effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has quickly disrupted American life. Surveys of opinions and attitudes and behaviors can track both these social disruptions and responses to them. The project utilizes an internet panel of 500 respondents, recruited daily throughout the period of contagion increase, for a total of 7,000 respondents.  The sample is nationally representative, with an oversample of individuals over age 55.  Once the peak number of cases has passed, daily sample size will be reduced to 250 respondents per day, for another sample totaling 7,500.  To ensure representation, the project will utilize quota sampling with post-stratification weighting.  Survey responses will be matched with local health department data, including number of tests, confirmed cases, and fatalities, as well as other policy data, including school closures, gubernatorial announcements and orders, and state-level legislative actions.  By including geographic measures, the project will ensure future researchers will be able to explore how community actions affected respondents’ attitudes, well-being, and public health behaviors.  Findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding scientific knowledge, inequality, political institutions, community, stress and social trust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The COVID-19 pandemic is dramatically remaking social relations.  Often, disasters tend to enhance community solidarity, but during the pandemic, social cohesion, trust, and connectedness have all declined. This funding supported the launch of the Covid-19 Social Change Survey, the largest and longest running panel survey on social, political, and cultural consequences of the pandemic.  The survey, which has been extended with other external funding, is administered every few months to about 8,000 Americans beginning in March 2020.     Project description  The COVID-19 pandemic is quickly making broad changes to society and upending ways of life across the globe.  Questions of public health behavior adoption, economic hardship, and political upheaval have underscored the social nature of the pandemic.  The ongoing nature of COVID, and the rise of SARS, MERS, and H1N1, underline the need to understand these phenomena &ndash; not just the epidemiology of pandemics, but the effective social policies and practices that create positive behaviors and mitigate harms.  While the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health problem, it is also a social problem, as public adoption of advised public health behaviors relies on an interplay of public policy, social communication, and public attitude.  Policy makers must devise responses, information and urgency must be expressed to the public, and individual attitudes and behaviors must change.  One of the key features of the COVID-19 pandemic was that it created the need for a fast-moving, engaged, and responsive citizenry.  Effective societal response relied on a nimble political order that could absorb information and create, enact, and administer responsive policy.  But effective response also required people be knowledgeable, active, and engaged in their communities and in political life &ndash; in other words, "good citizens" of an informed society.      Intellectual Merit  The survey has been used by dozens of researchers to explore questions related to social solidarity, political action, economic well-being, and cultural change.  Questions addressed include voting and political behavior, extremism, vaccine and mask hesitancy, racial tensions, cultural adoption, patriotism and institutional trust, solidarity and community, economic and social hardship, and child well-being.     Broader Impacts  The data was widely disseminated to the public and policy leaders, primarily thorough media distribution.  The data was covered, profiled, or used to inform discussion in the Washington Post, New York Times, Chicago Tribune, L.A. Times, Bloomberg News, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, and dozens of other smaller outlets.             Last Modified: 08/16/2021       Submitted by: Beth Red Bird]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
