<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Engineering surfaces at the nanometer scale will play a crucial role in a wide range of future technologies, including water desalination/purification for drinking and agriculture, efficient heating/cooling, waste heat recovery, advanced energy generation and storage, as well as biomedical applications such as advanced diagnostics and therapeutics.  The investigators seek demonstrate nanometer-scale and molecular-level tuning of material properties to create nano-engineered surfaces, or so-called “super-surfaces”.  The project will also train diverse scientists and engineers through interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and math education. A pilot undergraduate nanoscience program will be created for undergraduates, including rural, first-generation, non-traditional, and Hispanic students. This will provide students, including underrepresented groups, an opportunity to research and network with faculty and students at a major research university.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to demonstrate a novel technique for molecular-level tuning of interfacial thermal conductance, surface charge, capillary properties, and biological interaction of solid-liquid interfaces using a model gold-alkanethiol-water system. By employing a highly synergistic, integrated experimental and theoretical approach (to design, synthesize, and then re-design microscale surfaces), the study will advance the fundamental understanding of mixed monolayer structure, dynamics, and interfacial interactions. These studies will extend to a systematic investigation of cooling rate and substrate curvature on functionalized thiol domain formation on both flat substrates and nanoparticles. By demonstrating a commercially scalable technique for tuning solid-liquid interfacial transport properties and biomolecular sensitivity of surfaces with nanometer precision, the project addresses significant applied research needs in the field. This work is anticipated to lead to the development of a new nanoscale manufacturing paradigm for the rational engineering of solid-fluid interfaces that can be applied to a broad range of functional molecules and substrates. Additionally, it will explore possible means to control interfacial transport and biological interactions with functionalized and nanostructured materials.  Thus, these studies will provide considerable cross-cutting scientific and technological benefits, which will improve the overall quality of human life and health. Because the project will also establish a pilot collaborative nanoscience program including students from two primarily undergraduate institutions (Colorado Mesa University and Central Washington University), which serve large Hispanic, rural, first generation, and non-traditional student populations, with students and researchers at University of Notre Dame, this project will contribute to the diversity of the scientific workforce. Specifically, the integrated research and education design of the studies will aid in student engagement, retention, and success. Because of the COVID pandemic, the PIs at all three institutions are actively engaged in developing a plan for inter- and intra- institutional collaborative research during the pandemic, planning for increased laboratory safety and utilizing information technology solutions for communications to mitigate the disruptive effects of the pandemic on the project activities while assuring researcher safety. Lastly, through community outreach and education activities via Colorado Mesa University’s Eureka Science Museum and Maverick Innovation Center, the PIs will contribute to regional educational development and economic development through entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merits:</strong> The main project outcomes are discussed below in the context of each of the two main avenues of investigation, Nanoparticle-Protein Interactions and Droplet Wetting and Evaporation. These two systems permitted a broad investigation of both fundamental and applied aspects of nanostructured, molecularly functionalized interfaces, including studies of curved and flat interfaces, mixed composition monolayers, and investigation of thermal effects on resulting monolayers and their properties.</p> <p><em><strong>Nanoparticle-Protein Interactions: </strong></em>The interactions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with five different types of functionalized gold nanoparticle (NP) were studied using a variety of experimental techniques and complimentary simulations were begun via a new collaboration with Cleveland State University. Major accomplishments include the determination of binding constants for NP-BSA interactions using 3 independent methods, along with preliminary structural characterization of the interaction using TEM. For "pure" MEEE, MHA, and MPTMA functionalized particles (with no, negative, and positive net charge, respectively) the analysis yielded similar binding constants, demonstrating that Coulombic forces play a smaller role in NP-protein interactions for small (~10nm and smaller) NPs. Mixed monolayer NP-protein interactions have been shown to be much more complex than "pure" monolayer cases as exhibited by the very distinct behaviors of MPTMA-MEEE as compared to the MHA-MEEE and their "pure" counterparts. More details can be seen in the accompanying figures (Figs. 1-3). A manuscript is currently being prepared based on these findings. The present study has opened several new avenues of inquiry concerning better elucidating the role of Coulombic effects, conformational changes, and plaque formation, and raised important questions about the evaluating the limitations of UV-vis characterization for small NPs. Future and ongoing work inspired by these studies include the use of circular dichroism spectroscopy and extensive cryo-TEM imaging to help better understand the nature of NP-protein interactions.</p> <p><em><strong>Droplet Wetting and Evaporation:</strong></em> The wetting and evaporation of water droplets on a variety of macroscopically flat, molecularly functionalized heated metallic samples was studied to better understand the roles of molecular composition and nanoscale morphology on thermally driven transport and phase change. Pure Au (111) substrates were compared to substrates functionalized with monolayers of hydrophilic -COOH or hydrophobic -CH<sub>3</sub> terminated alkanethiols as well as samples with mixed -COOH/CH<sub>3</sub> monolayers; samples were fabricated at a constant ambient temperature as well as under time-dependent thermal stress. Major accomplishments include the demonstration of tuning of contact angles via mixed composition monolayers, evidence that this also controls the evaporation rate and resulting contact line motion. There is evidence that mixed monolayers can show similar, if not greater, mass loss via driven evaporation than "pure" monolayer cases, in agreement with results obtained on mechanically fabricated mixed systems. Additionally, a parameter-free model was developed by extending the Deegan and Popov models which connects droplet contact angle and mass which appears to yield reasonable quantitative agreement with experiment for droplets with sufficiently slow contact line motion. Interpretation of experimental results is supported by accompanying molecular dynamics simulations. See figures (Figs. 4-6). A manuscript is currently being prepared based on these results. On-going and future work based on these results includes improved measurements of mass loss rate on mixed samples and a deeper investigation into the nature of thermally treated surfaces, which have been demonstrated to promote a rapid "snap" de-pinning transition of the droplet contact line in some cases. Of particular interest for future investigation is how such surfaces interact with vapor bubbles introduced into surrounding bulk fluid.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> Beyond the outcomes related to the intellectual merits, this project has been one of three externally funded projects which has enabled the establishment of a pilot STEM undergraduate research program at Colorado Mesa University, a rural, primarily undergraduate institution with a wide range of underserved groups in its student population. This program has provided students with research, training, professional development, and networking opportunities which have led to graduate appointments, STEM positions, and even a recent NSF GRFP award. Furthermore, through the project, the foundation for a combined experimental and simulations thermal-fluids research program has been established, including laboratory infrastructure, and strengthened research partnerships with other institutions. The program successes in research-based student training and graduate placement have led to pursuit of further collaborative funding including a NASA-SMD Bridge Seed proposal roughly built on the model of the pilot program and an NSF EFRI-ELiS collaboration with a strong STEM training component.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/29/2023<br>      Modified by: Jarrod&nbsp;Schiffbauer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2001078/2001078_10702830_1690648534477_pFig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2001078/2001078_10702830_1690648534477_pFig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2001078/2001078_10702830_1690648534477_pFig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Data for NP-BSA interactions.
