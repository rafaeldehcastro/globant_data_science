<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the development of new disinfection devices that will reduce the number of food- and water-related illnesses.  This project will reduce spreading of infectious diseases, particularly in hospitals, nursing homes, farms, and veterinary clinics. The devices will be used to generate locally on-demand hydrogen-peroxide-based food-grade disinfectant using only water and electricity. The disinfectant will be used during the washing of fresh produce and ready-to-eat food, food packaging, and commercial ice-makers, where conventional disinfectants are not applicable in reasonable concentrations because they would leave residuals, including harmful byproducts and a strong unpleasant odor. The devices will also be used for the direct disinfection of drinking water, ice-makers, and recycled water. The devices will be especially useful for water disinfection in remote locations, where electricity can be generated using local and/or renewable energy sources.  On-demand decentralized water disinfection can be useful in remote locations and disasters affecting centralized clean water supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project utilizes properties of low-energy electric discharge in water for efficient generation and recombination of hydroxyl radicals that result in the production of hydrogen peroxide with low energy consumption. The technology development includes: 1) Positioning of electrodes in a controlled water stream; 2) Optimization of the power supply; 3) Development of a water circulation system with appropriate local pressure control; 4) Development of an efficient use of the treated water to minimize total consumption of electricity.  Verification and validation will take place through standard methods to optimize the systemâ€™s disinfection efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
