<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a non-invasive screening tool that will allow physicians to accurately and objectively screen for cardiovascular diseases, regardless of symptom presence. Cardiovascular diseases are often only diagnosed in late stages after heart function is severely diminished. Early detection of asymptomatic patients could lead to less invasive or earlier treatment to prevent disease progression and identify new late-stage patients in need of life-saving procedures. The proposed technology discriminates between abnormal and normal sounds, using artificial intelligence for improved efficiency and accuracy in cardiovascular screening.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic algorithm that uses heart sounds recorded from a digital stethoscope, similar to the devices currently used by doctors during routine physical exams, to classify cardiovascular disease stage. The proposed technology uses a database that correlates heart sounds to disease stage and cardiac function.  In addition, the proposed technology standardizes and analyzes descriptors of sound to reduce user-dependent disease classification error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The initial goal of our NSF I-Corps award was to perform customer discovery research related to our proposed technology to use digitally recorded heart sounds as an early, low-cost diagnostic tool for aortic valve disease. Aortic valve disease often goes undiagnosed until severe late stages, hindering early interventions. The under-diagnosis problem is especially prevalent in underserved populations, establishing the need for new low-coast screening platforms. We interviewed over 100 cardiologists, general practitioners, nurses, patients, and other individuals in the healthcare ecosystem. After finalizing our I-Corps interviews, we identified that our technology would have a more significant impact in identifying and monitoring patients with heart failure rather than aortic valve disease. Therefore, we have pivoted the aims of our technology development to focus on heart failure patients. Heart failure monitoring is needed to prevent unneccesary re-hospitalizations, especially in underserved populations. Unlike aortic valve disease, heart failure can be managed with existing therapeutics, and therefore, the application of our technology can immediately impact care for these patients. Accordingly, we view this market as a more appropriate entry point for our technology. We will then grow into other cardiovascular disease markets such as aortic valve disease. New aortic valve therapies are currently undergoing clinical trials. By the tiem that potential therapeutics are approved, we may have a mature technology ready to deploy in this market.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/21/2022<br>      Modified by: Joshua&nbsp;Hutcheson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
