<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with backscattered electron detector and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to support research and research training at St. Thomas University (UST) in Saint Paul, MN, a non-Ph.D. granting institution.  The instrument allows for micron scale textural and compositional imaging of geological, synthetic and biological materials and will support faculty and undergraduate research across multiple departments at UST including Geology, Biology and Engineering.  The investigators will engage undergraduates through experiential learning in methods of electron microscopy and plan recruitment of underrepresented students through the UST Minneapolis-based community college, the Dougherty Family College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEM will serve faculty and student interdisciplinary research spanning geology, environmental science, biology, materials science, and engineering.  Specific research applications will include: 1) characterization of the chemistry and textures of Miocene lacustrine microbialites as possible analogues for discovering stratigraphic evidence of previous life on Mars or evidence of early Earth microbial activity; 2) studies of hydrocarbon impacted soil minerals to better understand how metals mobilize in shallow aquifers; 3) characterization of taconite mineral aerosols liberated during iron ore mining in Minnesota; and 4) studies of 3D-printed elastomer composite materials that deform under magnetic fields, with potential uses in robotic musculature, drug delivery, biomedical implants, and a host of other applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The scanning electron microscope (SEM)?along with the supporting instrumentation (critical point dryer and sputter/carbon coater)??provided by this NSF Major Research Instrumentation Grant has had a significant impact on research and teaching at the University of St. Thomas. One of the major goals of this grant was to provide instrumentation for undergraduate student research and teaching in the geosciences, materials sciences, and environmental sciences. SEMs are essential instruments for research in the sciences and our campus was seriously hampered by the lack of one. We now use these instruments in geology and materials science courses, impacting tens of students each year. The greater impact, however, has been in its use in student-faculty collaborative research at our principally undergraduate institution. Students have used our new SEM facility to investigate volcanic eruption histories in Iceland and Nevada; analyze the signature of microbial life in ancient (13 million year-old) lakes; discern the compositions of pigments in Roman archeological artifacts from Croatia; explore the structure of complex silica gels; and investigate the properties of welds used in engineering applications, to name just a few research examples. Results from these research projects have been presented at regional and national conferences in the geosciences, environmental sciences and engineering, with undergraduate student presenters dominating these presentations. Several materials science papers have been published that made use of results from this lab and there are a number of similar, peer-reviewed publications in preparation in geology.

This outward-facing, glass-walled space will allow passers-by to see this instrumentation in operation over a large LCD screen.
