<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Allison Barnes is “Phospholipid metabolism adaptations in Zea mays under low temperature and low nutrients.” The host institution for the fellowship is North Carolina State University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Rubén Rellán-Álvarez.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As climate changes, crops must adjust to more and different environmental stresses. By understanding how crops adapted to the changes and stresses associated with domestication and migration, genes responsible for stress tolerance can be identified. One example of this is maize. It was domesticated in the valleys of Mexico, but was later moved to the highlands and had to become tolerant to the stresses of lower temperatures and less nutrient-rich soil. During times of stress, modification of cell membranes is crucial for survival. Thus, a specific target for this project is the synthesis of the building blocks of cell membranes, lipid biosynthesis. The research funded here will facilitate training in methods used to analyze or modify membrane lipid biosynthesis. The results will advance the field of plant biology, specifically in understanding how lipids respond to stress. They can be applied to the plant biotechnology and seed corn industry by identifying genes that can be modified to engineer more stress-tolerant crops to improve yield. Resources from this work will be turned into basic experiments and disseminated through volunteering with Wake County 4-H. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the role of phospholipid metabolism in maize adaptations to abiotic stresses such as cold and phosphorus deficiency will be one of the primary goals for the project. After domestication, maize migrated from a hot, tropical environment to a cold and phosphorus-deficient highland environment. It was found that phospholipid metabolism and, in particular, genes involved in the synthesis and degradation of phospholipids, are under selection in highland maize. In this project, some of the candidate genes involved will be functionally characterize, using maize mutants and heterologous expression systems in yeast. Finally, the possible contribution of highland alleles of these genes to temperate maize adaptation to cold environments in North America and Europe will be explored. Short-term, this research will deepen understanding of lipid metabolism and its role in local adaptation, advancing the NPGI goal of developing tools that aid in precision plant breeding targets for sustainable systems. Long-term, this characterization platform can be translated and applied to other metabolism genes that are important for plant adaptation to abiotic stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
