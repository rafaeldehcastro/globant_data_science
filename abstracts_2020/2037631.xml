<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a cost-effective regenerative curtain wall specifically configured to achieve building energy cost-savings and user satisfaction for net-zero energy building applications.  Building envelopes contribute to an increase in heating, cooling, and lighting loads inside the building while affecting occupant comfort. This technology, a high-performance regenerative curtain wall, is designed to curtail building energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to reduce broader societal, economic, and commercial impacts.  The successful application of the technology in commercial buildings is expected to accomplish 95 trillion Btu in annual energy reduction (i.e., $10 billion energy bill saving) and 13 million metric tons of CO2 sequestration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a multi-functional, energy-efficient curtain wall system. This regenerative curtain wall incorporates a 3D interlayer of concentrated micro-photovoltaic (CMPV) components within a double-pane glass assembly. Capitalizing on solar radiation, CMPV components consist of silicone-based solar cells with a Fresnel lens, which is a lightweight optical lens whose light concentration efficiency maximizes solar output within a small PV cell area. A key advantage of using the CMPV is that it allows optimization for various building performance needs, including energy efficiency (i.e., reduction of air conditioning load and maximum daylight transmission), user satisfaction (i.e., temperature, relative humidity, glare), and solar-powered energy production. The optimization algorithm for geometric configurations of the system may maximize power production and year-round energy savings for different climate conditions and building orientations where sunlight level varies. Reductions in building operational energy costs from lighting, cooling, and heating loads may result in energy cost savings. In addition, the systemâ€™s ability to allow viewing and daylight penetration is expected to improve the health and well-being of building occupants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
