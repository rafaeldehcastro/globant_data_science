<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potnetial of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve hydroponic production of leafy greens.  Growing food indoors hydroponically produces locally grown vegetables with minimal or no pesticide or herbicide use. A key challenge is the limitation on crop volume based on farm size. This project will advance a fertilizer that can grow an additional 10 to 20% more with current space and equipment. It will have an impact on global farming by increasing crop volume without environmental impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will explore translation of an innovative method for trisulfide production for use in fertilizers.  Tasks include development of a simple, one-step synthesis of the fertilizer from inexpensive, commercially available starting materials. Further work includes investigation of synthesis parameters for development of a process at the 500 g scale, then further exploration of the parameter space for eventual industrial production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
