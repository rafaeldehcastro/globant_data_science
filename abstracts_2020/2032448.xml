<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address a key challenge in the response to COVID-19, namely manufacturing sufficient quantities of novel therapeutics and vaccines. This project can shorten the development times of drugs by as much as 6 months, accelerating translation of new therapeutics. This technology will also enable more testing, thereby increasing the performance and potentially reducing the side effects of these drugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project advances the manufacturing of biologics, which starts with a high performing clonal cell line derived (by definition) from a single cell. Developing such a cell line today takes up to 6 months due to iterative screening and testing to assure quality and performance. The proposed project aims to enable selection of a high performing cell clone in one day compared to many months by using a proprietary single cell proteomics platform, at an unprecedented throughput rather than lengthy, iterative selection, clonal expansion and analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
