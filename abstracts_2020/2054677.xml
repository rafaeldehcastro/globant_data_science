<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[On 10 August 2020, a particularly intense derecho produced widespread high-wind damage from eastern Nebraska through northern Indiana, resulting in 3.8 billion USD in estimated agricultural losses in Iowa. Derechos, or long-lived windstorms produced by mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), remain an important atmospheric phenomenon to understand because they produce large-scale wind damage areas, varying from 20 – 200 km in width to hundreds of kilometers long. This award will allow a multidisciplinary scientific team (i.e., atmospheric scientists, remote sensing experts, wind and structural engineers) to perform high-resolution numerical simulations and detailed damage surveys across multiple spatial scales to investigate storm processes in derechos. Relating detailed documentation of high-wind damage with storm processes can provide vital information on extreme wind production in derechos and storm damage potential, leading to improved understanding of severe-storm processes, radar interpretation, and risk communication associated with warnings to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storm characteristics and near-surface wind flow of 10 August 2020 derecho will be investigated through 1) high-resolution simulations of the event using a state-of-the-art numerical modeling system as a proxy for the real event, and 2) detailed comparisons of radar signatures to damage information provided by 2D and 3D analyses of unpiloted aerial systems (UAS) data, satellite imagery, and ground truth surveys. Simulations that best depict the evolution of the derecho will be analyzed to explore the mechanisms responsible for the unique physical characteristics of this event that were responsible for the extreme wind production. The large-scale character of the damaging winds over vegetation and crops susceptible to long-term damage and passage of the derecho’s core close to Des Moines and Davenport National Weather Service radars in Iowa provide a unique opportunity to better connect damage information to velocity structures sampled by radar. The detailed analysis of wind damage produced in this study will provide an unprecedented validation dataset for the high-resolution numerical simulations. This unusually comprehensive dataset will be used to understand the physical processes responsible for extreme wind damage. Additionally, detailed damage documentation can also be used to calibrate satellite-based assessments in future high-wind events and could enable the development of additional damage descriptors based to vegetation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

We investigated storm mechanisms involved in derechos and extreme wind production, using three different approaches: high-resolution numerical simulations, radar analysis, and damage information (ground, Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS), and satellite data).</p> <p>High-resolution numerical simulations, which are commonly used to forecast potential severe weather events, can also be used to provide insight on severe storm mechanisms. The Warn-On-Forecast high resolution model predicted a strong low-level rotation pretty close to the to where they were observed (e.g. near Marshalltown, IA) (see Figure 1). The downscaled WoFS simulations provided insight on the physical mechanisms driving the destructive winds and the life cycle of key circulation features, such as mesovortices like those identified by radar and UAS damage surveys. The mesovortices along the gust front were strongest below 2 km AGL and extended up to about 5 km but were rather transient (lifetimes of ~2 min).</p> <p>Radar data analysis revealed mesovortices embedded in the larger-scale rear-inflow near Marshalltown, Iowa. These mesovortices developed on the north side of an intense rear-inflow surge separate from the larger rear-inflow channel farther to the south. Figure 2 is an example of the flow and vortices in the area northwest of the Tama/Toledo IA area shortly before 1700 UTC. This is a good example of the two kinds of flow features thought to produce damage in this event: the ~50 km wide swath of flow approaching 50 m/s, and the occasional and chaotic occurrence of potentially tornadic vortices on the northern edge. These mesovortices (potentially tornadic) were transient and embedded within an overall chaotic flow. The secondary inflow surge correlated with the location of hail damage, identified with our change-detection analysis later became the main surge, producing intense winds over Cedar Rapids.</p> <p>Satellite and UAS imagery revealed varying degrees of damage within the derecho affected area and as a function of storm mode. Satellite analysis captured hail damage near the area of genesis and widespread wind damage to vegetation (crops, trees) over central Iowa. Change detection of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) pre- and post-event data better captured the spatial extent of damage compared to optical imagery (Sentinel-2) (see Figure 3). SAR can penetrate clouds and canopy cover, capturing the physical constituents of plant structures and allowing for more detailed damage detection in rural environments.</p> <p>UAS imagery provided detailed documentation of damage to vegetation and highlighted the role of exposure in damage footprints. The very fine spatial resolution (centimeter scale) of our UAS imagery provides information on specific storm-scale characteristics of the event. Figure 4 shows examples of the detailed damage information captured by UAS imagery relative to satellite imagery. The top row shows hail damage near the genesis point of the derecho in which the UAS image captures obliterated/shredded foliage and stalks due to hail impacts. The middle row shows straightline wind damage and detailed cornfall pattern captured in UAS imagery. The bottom row shows evidence of convergent windflow associated with tornadic circulation near Tama, Iowa. This tornado was one of four tornado damage paths that our UAS imagery was used to confirm tornado damage that were inconclusive in traditional ground surveys and satellite imagery.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/28/2023<br>      Modified by: Melissa&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wagner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2054677/2054677_10708007_1677632115327_Derecho_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2054677/2054677_10708007_1677632115327_Derecho_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2054677/2054677_10708007_1677632115327_Derecho_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">WoFS 8 hour forecast swaths of the ensemble 90th percentile values for updraft helicity within a 9 kilometer neighborhood (color shading) initialized from 1200 UTC.
