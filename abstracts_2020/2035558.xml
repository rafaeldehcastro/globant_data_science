<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The research project seeks to fill a fundamental gap in our knowledge of how RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) accurately transcribes the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. The goals of the project are to determine the mechanisms whereby the essential RdRp enzyme and several collaborating partner proteins function in the viral life cycle. The research outcomes will enable better understanding of how current antiviral nucleotide analogs such as Remdesivir inhibit RdRp function, as well as development of new therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 going forward. The project will also support training of two Ph.D. students, both of whom are from underrepresented groups in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transient state kinetic approaches are planned to interrogate the nucleotide addition reaction catalyzed by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, nsp12, and the essential cofactors nsp7, nsp8, and nsp14. A central hypothesis to be tested is that the nsp14 exonuclease is essential for increased fidelity of the nsp12 polymerase. To address this hypothesis, the kinetic mechanisms of correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by nsp12/nsp7/nsp8 complex as well as removal of incorrect nucleotides catalyzed by nsp14 will be determined. The resulting mechanistic knowledge and methods development will better define these proteins as targets for drug discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is made by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) corona virus and now SARS-CoV-2 have been responsible for three coronavirus outbreaks since 2002. In 2019 the SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the largest pandemic in recent history. This pandemic was responsible for substantial loss of life and a massive downturn in both the US and global economies.  Coronaviruses are positive strand RNA viruses. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp). Essential for replication of this virus is the ability to transcribe the RNA and subsequently translate the RNA into proteins that can do the required work. Transcription of the viral genome is carried out by the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), nsp12.  Additional proteins, including nsp7, nsp8, and nsp14 aid nsp12.  Specifically, it has been hypothesized that the proteins aid in reducing the probability of errors in transcription, i.e. increased transcription fidelity.  Also, they aid in assuring that nsp12 remains associated with the RNA template during transcription versus dissociating partial transcripts.  Our work advanced knowledge by developing a purification strategy for nsp7, 8, 12, and 14 for downstream activity measurements.  We successfully overexpressed nsp7, nsp8, and nsp14 using bacterial overexpression systems. The overexpressed proteins were purified to greater than 95 % purity.  We carried out analytical ultracentrifugation experiments on nsp7 and nsp8 and showed that both proteins self-associated, likely into dimers. Further, we showed that nsp12, which was overexpressed from bacterial cells, did not exhibit polymerase activity.  Insect cell lines were developed for the overexpression and isolation of nsp12.  However, nsp12 isolated in this way still exhibited little to no polymerase activity. These observations have advanced knowledge by leading to the hypothesis that assembly of nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 is likely limiting the observation of transcription.  With this knowledge in hand, examination of the heteroassociation properties is of utmost interest.  This work has advanced desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts) by providing training for three doctoral students.  This includes training in advanced molecular biology techniques, analytical methods, protein and nucleic acid chemistry, transient state kinetics, and analytical ultracentrifugation.  These training opportunities will lead to these three students completing their Ph.D. work in a variety of areas.  This work has also benefited teaching and learning.  We routinely use examples from our current research activities during physical chemistry lectures on chemical kinetics.  Similarly, hands on application of many of the techniques that we use in the lab are taught to students in our advanced biophysical chemistry lab class.  In fact, when this class was taught in the spring of 2021, the nsp12 protein was used as an example to demonstrate the need for careful biophysical characterizations.  This was most impactful as the class was particularly interested in SARS-CoV2 research.          Last Modified: 12/30/2022       Submitted by: Aaron L Lucius]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
