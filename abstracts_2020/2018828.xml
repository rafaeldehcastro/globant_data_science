<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Overview: This proposal seeks support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to facilitate the organization of a workshop titled: "Forging Connections between Machine Learning, Data Science, and Power Systems Research." The workshop will examine theoretical and algorithmic advances from the areas of machine learning and data science that have the potential to address contemporary challenges in modeling, analysis, operations, and control of power systems. It will seek to do so by engaging the participation of leading researchers from power systems, machine learning, and data science as well as related enabling and synergistic application areas such as robotics and transportation networks. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Contemporary advances in the broad areas of data-driven computing and control hold tremendous potential in aiding the transition of the power system to a truly sustainable, resilient, and distributed infrastructure that can accommodate new generation, distribution, and end-use technology at scale. With this in mind, the proposed workshop will focus on teasing out foundational theories and methods from the areas of machine learning and data science that are relevant to research problems in power systems. Through a broad-based schedule that includes keynote talks, panel discussions, and breakout sessions, leading experts from the aforementioned areas will get a unique and unparalleled opportunity to exchange technical ideas that will result in new theories, methods, and algorithms tailored to realizing the next generation power system. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Broader impacts of the proposed workshop will follow from a variety of avenues. First, it will serve as a unique opportunity for researchers from the areas of machine learning and data science to engage with leading experts in power systems to find common ground for engagement in research and development for the bulk power system: a critical infrastructure that underpins and governs societal progress. The workshop will also provide a unique stage to showcase and share outcomes from cutting-edge NSF funded research. Researchers will have an unparalleled opportunity to build collaborative scholarly and institutional partnerships that transcend boundaries imposed by their respective technical areas. Finally, participation of researchers from minorities and underrepresented groups, as well as early-career researchers will be encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
