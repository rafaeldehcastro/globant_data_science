<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award will support travel to a workshop that will take place from November 16 to 20, 2020 at the Banff International Research Station. It is the fifth in a series of research collaboration conferences. Much of the time during the workshop is reserved for collaboration in small groups led by senior researchers in the field. The major goals of this workshop are to produce significant and impactful research in number theory;  help train graduate students and postdocs by providing exposure to new topics and experience with collaborative research and the publication process; strengthen and extend a collaborative research network in number theory and related areas; and enable faculty at smaller colleges to actively participate in research collaborations. More information is available at http://www.birs.ca/events/2020/5-day-workshops/20w5175 and http://www-personal.umich.edu/~weiho/win5/. &lt;br/&gt;The award, which provides travel funding for underrepresented minorities in the mathematical sciences to participate in the workshop at the Banff International Research Stations will also strengthen accessibility by faculty from smaller institutions and at earlier career stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will support the continued development of the number theory community by bringing together researchers at various stages of their careers (including graduate students, postdoctoral researches, tenure-track faculty, and senior mathematicians) for research collaboration and mentoring. The scientific focus of the workshop is on cutting-edge topics in number theory, including dynamical Mahler measure, mock theta functions and related combinatorics, number theory in function fields, q-Analogues of generalized van Hamme supercongruences, representations of p-adic groups, self-dual normal bases and cohomological invariants, supersingular isogeny graphs in cryptography, and zeta functions with coefficients in the Grothendieck-Witt ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
