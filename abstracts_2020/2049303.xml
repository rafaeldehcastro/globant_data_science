<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Wild birds often turn up in unexpected places, far away from where they breed or usually migrate. These presumably lost individuals are called “vagrants”.  Historically, they have viewed as sad events – an unfortunate consequence of something gone wrong. This project will explore an alternative perspective – that vagrancy is a normal event, caused by young birds from rapidly growing populations exploring the world for new, less-crowded places to live. This idea will be tested by placing trackers on 50 Lesser Black-backed Gulls captured in New York and Massachusetts, then recording their positions by satellite for roughly 2 years. The species is not known to breed nearby. The closest major breeding colonies are in Greenland and those colonies have been growing quickly.  Therefore, researchers expect the tracked gulls to be from Greenland and for some to return there.  In addition to tracking data, genetic testing will be used to link individuals captured in New England to populations in Greenland or perhaps Iceland. Data from this project will be useful in understanding birds’ abilities to respond to a changing climate. In particular, this work will reveal the extent to which some seabirds actively explore and adapt to a changing world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use ICARUS GPS units to track movements of 50 Lesser Black-backed Gulls trapped by cannon net at Fire Island, New York and Nantucket Island, Massachusetts.  Based on position data from the GPS units, three predictions will be tested: (1) Wintering birds trapped in North America will return to Greenland.  This prediction is based on the observation that the greatest population growth of Black-backed Gulls anywhere during the period of largest increase of wintering birds in North America (1990-present) was in Greenland. (2) Non-adult birds (&lt;4 years old, determined by plumage) will engage in more exploratory behavior, as measured by First Passage Time Analysis, than adult birds. (3) Birds trapped in North America will be derived from Greenland populations. This will be tested by population genetics, based on genetic analysis of feathers from birds captured in New England with those from birds in Greenland, Iceland and western Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Vagrant birds (which are found far distances from where they originated), long thought to be mutant or otherwise navigationally incompetent individuals, have now been shown to be the outer fringe of a growing population. Vagrancy is the mechanism by which growing populations are able to colonize newly available habitats (Grinnell 1922; Veit 2000, 2008; Zawadzki et al. 2019). In fact, although most dispersal distances are small, many instances of very long-distance dispersal have been documented.&nbsp; See <strong>Figure 1</strong> for two data-rich examples, including Ring-billed Gulls. Since changes in habitats are happening with greater magnitude and a greater rate than ever before (e.g. Drinkwater et al. 2003; Sydeman et al. 2013), there is a premium upon populations of birds to explore, so that they can attain habitats that have become newly suitable due to changing climate.&nbsp; Our recent research (Veit 2000, Zawadzki et al. 2019, Acosta Alamo et al. 2022) clearly identifies a strong link between high rates of population growth and vagrancy, so that the largest numbers of vagrants accompany peak reproduction, as large numbers of young spread out in search of new territories.</p> <p>Vagrants form the "fodder of evolution" in the words of Davis and Watson (2018), and vagrancy offers the mechanism for escape from extinction due to changing climate.&nbsp; We will explore the data in support of this idea for seabirds and ask whether seabirds are likely to disperse over a sufficiently large spatial scale and in a timely manner to be able exploit new habitats, as these habitats become suitable.&nbsp; Accumulation of substantial data on bird movement in recent years show that vagrancy is a broadly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">typical</span> behavior of birds, as well as many other organisms, and, far from being biologically inconsequential,&nbsp;often results in colonization or recolonization of novel breeding sites.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that vagrancy is a positive response to improved conditions rather than a desperate move to escape catastrophe and is thus carried out by individuals in top physical condition.&nbsp; Either of these outcomes is a very different view of vagrancy being a consequence of incompetent navigation. Putting these ideas together, we suggest that, in order to colonize newly available habitats, pockets of elevated reproduction in response to abundant resources must exist to generate vagrants. In order to experience whether previously unoccupied areas are suitable for breeding, birds must first travel to these places, and this initial movement of discovery constitutes vagrancy by definition.&nbsp; We will also explore the opposite scenario in which adults from declining populations initiate dispersal in order to escape deteriorating conditions (Acosta Alamo et al. 2022).</p> <p>We placed 15 Microwave Telemetry PTT (18g) on 15 Lesser Black-backed Gulls at Nantucket, MA in January and February 2023, using "backpack" harnesses with weak links designed to fall off within 3 years (Thaxter et al. 2014, 2016; Clewley et al. 2021).&nbsp; We captured the birds using a cannon-net.&nbsp; This required some trial and error on our part, as the birds were much more leery of people than we had imagined or experienced before.&nbsp; We attempted many baits (among other things, these savvy birds rejected <em>French fries</em> and herring). &nbsp;Nevertheless, we managed to trap 14 birds in two consecutive days in February 2023 (we captured the other bird in late January 2023).&nbsp; A critical part of our project is to measure differences in movement behavior among age classes, so in total we instrumented 2 birds &lt; one year old (="1W", 3 two-year-old birds (="2W"), 3 three-year-old birds (="3W") and 7 adults.&nbsp; About half of the birds remained until May at Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard and another 5 travelled south as far as North Carolina and Delaware, with a majority foraging on landfills in the NY-NJ area.
