<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Under the direction of Dr. William A. Parkinson at the Field Museum of Natural History, William P. Ridge, a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago will conduct archaeological fieldwork to examine the social responses and adaptations in small-scale societies to large-scale population shifts and economic changes. The modern world is characterized by dense urban landscapes and massive degrees of political and economic inequality, but these are recent developments within the human experience. Since the end of the Pleistocene, most humans have lived in small, autonomous, village societies. Through archaeological research, archaeologists can examine extended periods of time – centuries or millennia – and trace the emergent forms of characteristics that have come to define the contemporary world, such as social differentiation, economic inequality, the negotiation of cultural identities, and the physiological effects of dense populations. Why do people come together to live in ever larger populations? How are social relationships and cultural identities reshaped by shifting populations? How and under what circumstances do such aggregations fail? With global and domestic population movements more frequent than ever before, such questions are increasingly pertinent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral student and colleagues will examine how social structure and population changed in prehistoric village societies. The research will consist primarily of targeted excavations at prehistoric settlement sites. Excavations will take place at prehistoric villages that belong to a period when there was a juxtaposition between, on the one hand, the disappearance of large settlements, and, on the other hand, the establishment of rich burial grounds. Combining excavation data from households with the high-precision chronological data of radiocarbon dates the project will elucidate how demographic and economic processes occurring at the regional level effected the nature of local society and at what pace these changes took place. The research team will generate models to explain human responses to population and economic fluctuations. The project will focus on training and data generation and will provide educational and research opportunities for both students and scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Between June 2021 and January 2023, 36 radiocarbon dates were acquired from eight Copper Age sites in the region, from both new fieldwork and existing museum collections. This collection of radiocarbon dates doubled the number of Copper Age dates in the region and included the first radiocarbon dates for the Bodrogkereszt&uacute;r culture and the Late Copper Age. The radiocarbon dates further clarified the chronological relationship of the Tiszapolg&aacute;r and Bodrogkereszt&uacute;r cultures, demonstrating that they represent the earlier and latter parts of the Early Copper Age (4500-4000 BC).

The excavations recovered a massive number of artifacts, including over 140 kg of ceramics, 50 kg of animal bones, and dozens of obsidian bladelets. The ceramics were analyzed in June 2023 and revealed a diverse range of vessel types and decorations.

One of the principal challenges in studying the Copper Age is the lack of chronological precision, mainly due to a lack of radiocarbon dates for the period. This project more than doubled the number of Copper Age radiocarbon dates for the K&ouml;r&ouml;s Region and included some of the only radiocarbon dates from settlements of the Bodrogkereszt&uacute;r and Baden cultures for the entire Great Hungarian Plain. The collection of radiocarbon dates obtained in the project has greatly improved the chronological understanding of the whole region and allows for a more precise examination of the social changes that occurred in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> millennia.
