<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from helping individuals achieve higher levels of wellness.  The proposed system will collect data from a user’s wearables and other devices (smart watch, wifi scale, sleep tracker…) for a novel solution. The proposed project will develop an artificial intelligence (AI) coach monitoring fatigue and fitness to continuously optimize an integrated fitness, diet, and sleep plan.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use advanced AI and Deep Reinforcement Learning methods to develop a system that automatically builds and updates a training plan integrating workouts, diet and recovery subject to real-life conditions such as work, sickness, etc.  Through advanced data preparation leveraging deep learning techniques, the system will cleanse the data to ensure high quality input data to the digital avatar. This avatar uses Reinforcement Learning to learn by exploration the best individualized courses of action for pre-specified goals. This system will form a novel personalized, predictive, proactive solution for monitoring health in real time at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
