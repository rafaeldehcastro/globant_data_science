<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Vulnerable populations are especially at-risk if they consume inaccurate information about COVID-19. This project generates data and analyses that can be used to better limit and control the spread of inaccurate information about COVID-19 that targets vulnerable populations. The data shows how the amount and focus of inaccurate information on several online platforms changed after the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis, and how the information moved across platforms and among different groups. The project examines how to potentially mitigate the effects of inaccurate information about the pandemic on public health, and in particular seeks to protect individuals in vulnerable groups from relying on inaccurate information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project collects data on online groups across multiple online platforms. Using a combination of human- and machine-coding, the diffusion of inaccurate information targeted to vulnerable groups across platforms is documented. Mathematical modeling is used to understand the dynamics of how inaccurate information diffuses across networks, as well as the relative potential effectiveness of strategies to reduce its spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our cross-disciplinary project addresses the key societal questions of how to efficiently find and track weaponized COVID-19 misinformation, understand when it will grow and flourish, and understand the effectiveness of potential social media platform policies to combat this.  Within political science, we expect our findings and data to be useful to scholars of the diffusion of online misinformation, extremism radicalization, and hate and racial resentment.  More broadly but within the academy, our work is likely to be of interest to network scientists across a broad range of fields.  The mathematical models generated  by the project will serve to inform the social science community about a new way to overcome the key challenges of computational science agent-based models: by modeling the mesoscale-level interactions between clusters of agents using known empirical results, and by using renormalization from statistical physics in order to scale up clusters across different scales by treating them as renormalized versions of the system at lower scales, meaning that the problem complexity can then be scaled to within practical limits.  We have published our results in three peer-reviewed journal articles, and a fourth journal article is under peer-review as of October 2022.  We may published additional peer-reviewed work based on our results in the future.       Last Modified: 10/05/2022       Submitted by: Yonatan Lupu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
