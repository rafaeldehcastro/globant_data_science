<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The vast majority of individuals in the world spend at least 90% of their time indoors. While indoors, these individuals are exposed to a combination of artificial and natural light extending into the nighttime hours. In addition to our own light exposure, indoor microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, are also exposed to differing combinations of natural and artificial light. At present, the consequences of light exposure on the microbial world are poorly understood. The goal of this research is to examine the consequences of varying light exposure on the microbial world. By creating a better understanding of the impact building illumination has on microorganisms, researchers can better understand how it might be possible to control their activity, survival, and functions within the built environment. Additional benefits to society resulting from this research result from science experiences for K-12 teachers to teach them how science is performed through experiential learning. This effort will enhance STEM education through incorporation of teacherâ€™s science training in the classroom. Further benefits result disseminating results through public talks and social media outreach focused on children and young adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research project is to understand the mechanisms underlying microbial responses to architectural lighting conditions within the built environment. This will be achieved by assessing the impact of light on microbial communities using viability quantitative polymerase chain reaction, high resolution genome sequencing, and transcriptomic analysis. Axenic cultures isolated in microcosms will be exposed to conditions simulating typical indoor lighting, reflectance, spatial, temperature, and humidity conditions in the built environment. Varying light exposure include presence/absence of light, as well as diurnal light cycles typical in office environments. Following characterization of the axenic cultures, mock microbial communities composed of the axenic cultures will be exposed to the same lighting conditions, permitting discernment of light-associated impacts in survival and transcriptional output from those communities induced through competition. High-resolution dynamics of microbial survival and transcriptional expression will be assessed from individual species function to reveal information on the mechanisms of symbiosis, survival, and demise of microbial component species and communities associated with light in the built environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
