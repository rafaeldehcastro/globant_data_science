<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to explore applications of open source development in computer hardware.  This model will enable new ideas and semiconductor-based technologies to be envisioned, developed, and deployed. This project will enable collaborative networking to build the developer ecosystem around sophisticated chip implementations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I will advance the development of state-of-art hardware tools for novel integrated circuit chip implementations. The system will scale from a 28 nm process to sub-7 nm semiconductor chip manufacturing nodes. Project objectives include: 1) implementation of open source models in hardware design; 2) initial design of circuit design blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF SBIR Phase 1 grant (#2013802: "Leading a Hardware Revolution through Open Source") funded the advanced research and development of an open source RISC-V multicore SoC (System on a Chip) and a process to support open source hardware development in general. The SoC would be similar to a "Raspberry Pi" but built with open source hardware and software. It was ultimately determined via the NSF SBIR Boot Camp and I-Corps processes that there was little market interest in this SoC or open source process. Research was shifted to the development of a RISC-V manycore accelerator toolkit. This toolkit, implemented with both open source and proprietary tools, enables the rapid construction of high performance, high data throughput accelerators for FPGA and ASIC targets.  Accelerators for machine learning and genomic sequencing were developed with this toolkit to demonstrate its effectiveness. The low-level complexities of hardware development are hidden from the software developer, allowing for the deployment of hardware by software engineers with minimal hardware engineering experience. Using the hardware accelerators generated for an FPGA, 1000X performance over software only solutions was achieved.  The recipients of this grant are actively talking to potential customers and aiming to develop a handful of proof-of-concept deliveries in the 2021-22.  Launching a company and developing this technology would not have been possible without the generous support of the NSF.
