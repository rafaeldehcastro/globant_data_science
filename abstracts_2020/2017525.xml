<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[A word like “cat” calls to mind different associations for different individuals (e.g., allergic reactions versus comforting companion). But at the same time, whatever meaning English speakers have paired with the word “cat” must be at least similar enough to enable successful communication. This suggests some level of invariance in meaning, but leaves open the level of detail at which our understanding of the word is shared. If speakers do share fine-grained details about a word’s meaning, the question of how they acquired those details arises. No two children have the exact same experience in the course of language learning, so how would they come to have a common understanding of a word? This project explores both questions – what aspect of word meaning is shared across speakers and how is this meaning acquired? – for the quantificational words “each” and “every”. Gaining a better understanding of how speakers represent and acquire these words will improve our understanding of the logical primitives of thought and the ways in which children make use of their input when learning a language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research brings together approaches from various fields. Vision science experiments test participants’ memory for set and individual properties to determine whether the meanings of “each” and “every” implicate representations of sets. A linguistic corpus analysis identifies the data present in speech to children. Techniques from developmental psychology are used to test whether children in fact use these cues in learning the relevant difference between “each” and “every”. The project pursues the hypothesis that while a sentence like “every circle is green” implicates representations of sets (the set of circles), the minimally different “each circle is green” implicates only representations of individuals and their properties. The project also involves conducting outreach about related issues (e.g., the relationship between language and thought more generally) to local families and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

As a case study, it focused on the English quantificational words "each" and "every". Though these words are obviously similar (both are universal quantifiers, as opposed to proportional, like "most", or existential, like "some"), they are also subtly different ("each cake needs sugar" calls to mind a few particular cakes, maybe on a cooking show, but "every cake needs sugar" sounds like something in a recipe book). This project pursued the hypothesis that the meanings of "each" and "every" differ in the following way: "each" calls for treating the things quantified over (e.g., cakes in "each cake") as independent individuals, whereas "every" calls for treating the things quantified over as a group. This formal difference in their meanings was hypothesized to lead expressions with "each" and "every" to invite the activation of two separate non-linguistic cognitive systems: the system for representing object-files and the system for representing ensembles.   In support of this hypothesis, we found that when people were shown pictures of shapes and asked questions like "is each circle green?", they were able to recall properties of individual circles (e.g., what color was that particular circle). But when they were shown the very same pictures and asked instead questions like "is every circle green?", they were less likely to recall individual properties, though they were more likely to recall properties of the whole collection (e.g., the number of circles displayed).

More generally, this project offers an example of how the study of linguistic meaning and the study of non-linguistic perceptual systems can inform one another.
