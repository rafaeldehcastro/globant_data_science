<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians, is one of the most economically and ecologically important species in coastal areas of New York State and the region. In summer/fall 2019, 90% of the scallops in eastern Long Island died, and this coincided with the emergence of an undescribed parasite that disrupts the kidney of infected animals. Genetic analysis showed that the parasite belongs to the Coccidia subclass of parasites, and this pathogen is now designated bay scallop Coccidia or BSC. This project will identify how BSC infects and kills scallops, and why some scallops are resistant to infection or death. Results from this study  promotes the progress of science because research will identify mechanisms that regulate host-parasite interactions in scallops, and may help us understand how other Coccidia cause disease in economically important systems. It advances the national prosperity and the bioeconomy because results help scallop farmers and ecologists prevent or minimize death of this economically-important crop. This research will also provide tools to enable a broad research community working on apicomplexan parasites of invertebrates. This proposal also uses funding to train a post-doc, and graduate and undergraduate students to train the next generation of scientists. Results expected from this work will facilitate the recovery of bay scallops in New York waters, and will serve as a reference if BSC spreads to other coastal regions in the USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the common nature of Coccidia infection in invertebrates, very little is known about the biology of these microorganisms and the factors that regulate infection success. This RAPID will use an ongoing epizootic to generate information needed to characterize an ecologically- and economically-important member of the Coccidia that infects bay scallop (BSC). The study will use a combination of high-throughput sequencing techniques (genome and RNA sequencing), traditional cellular techniques (parasite purification, primary cell culture), and molecular biology methods to characterize BSC and probe the relationship between parasite life stages and scallop health; to evaluate how the disease will develop with the onset of summer conditions, conditions thought to be stressful to bay scallops; and to determine what genetic and environmental factors differentiate resistant scallops from susceptible ones. The new data are expected to solve an information gap that has been hampering the understanding of the mechanisms of survival and disease of BSCs in marine invertebrates. Moreover, the genetic information obtained from this work can be the basis for developing diagnostic tools to identify BSC infections and outbreaks in the future, which helps the bioecomony. This research will identify mechanisms that regulate host-parasite interactions in scallops, and may help us understand how other Coccidia cause disease in economically important systems. This research will also provide tools to enable a broad research community working on apicomplexan parasites of invertebrates. This award also uses funding to train a post-doc, and graduate and undergraduate students to train the next generation of STEM researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The bay scallop is one of the most economically and ecologically important shellfish species along the east and Gulf coasts of the U.S. and is emblematic in New York where it represents the official state shell. Since 2019, scallop populations in the Peconic Bays, NY, have suffered yearly summer mortality events (well in excess of 90% reduction in adult scallop biomass) associated with the emergence of an undescribed parasite that disrupts the kidney of infected animals, leading the U.S. Department of Commerce to declare the Peconic Bay scallop a fishery disaster (Tettelbach et al., 2023). This 1-year project was designed to provide initial responses to the massive mortality outbreak and characterize the infectious agent, but also to generate basic information on environmental and biological factors that could regulate disease development and scallop mortality.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These investigations allowed morphological and molecular characterization of the scallop parasite, which was proposed as a new member of the recently established Marosporida clade (<em>Apicomplexa</em>), provisionally named Bay Scallop Marosporida (BSM; Pales Espinosa et al., 2023). Several diagnostics tools have also been developed including a rapid microscopic diagnostic test and a quantitative PCR test. These tools were then used to monitor disease development and follow parasite dynamics in the field. Results showed that BSM disrupts multiple scallop tissues including kidney, adductor muscle, gill, and gonad. Microscopy observations allowed the identification of both intracellular and extracellular stages of the parasite. Field surveys demonstrated a strong seasonal signature in disease prevalence and intensity, as severe cases and mortality increase as summer progresses. Results of laboratory experiments showed that temperature represents the major driver for disease development and resulting mortality, providing a solid example of how climate alterations are translated into major disease outbreaks in marine organisms. In this framework, BSM appears to synergistically interact with the increasingly stressful environmental conditions to impair the host and lead to mortality. Preliminary genomic investigations allowed the identification of two major genetic lineages of bay scallop in NY: a northern lineage and a southern lineage (the latter was absent in NY ~25 years ago), which appear to display different resistance/tolerance to the disease. More interesting, preliminary analysis of genetic data generated from scallops collected throughout a severe mortality event in the field clearly shows a shift in scallop?s genetic make-up as summer progresses, yielding a markedly segregated profile among survivors. These results suggest that scallops that survive summer months are genetically distinct from those that succumb to the mortality, supporting a genetic basis for resistance. If confirmed, these findings have the potential to enable the design of mitigation strategies (e.g., choice of stocks used for enhancement and restoration programs).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Members of the research team also used this project as a framework for the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers on state-of-the-art approaches and techniques in areas ranging from ecological physiology to pathology and high-throughput genomics. Research results were disseminated through various means including public and professional meetings. Given the high stakes surrounding the collapse of the fishery, particular focus was made to transmit research information to local and regional stakeholders. While there are pending questions that still need to be answered, the scientific information generated by this 1-year project allows a better framing for potential strategies to mitigate the disease and protect and enhance natural resources.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class="Pa4"><strong>References cited:</strong></p> <p>Pales Espinosa E, Bouallegui Y, Grouzdev D, Brianik C, Czaja R, Geraci-Yee S, Kristmundsson A, Muehl M, Schwaner C, Tettelbach ST, Tobi H, Allam B.
