<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental research in the mm-wave and sub-THz regime needed for 5G and future wireless networks is held back by the high cost of instrumentation needed to conduct research. The cost of such experiments is typically over $200,000. Given these costs, academics struggle to perform high-impact scientific and engineering research that depends on experimental verification of wireless communication theory. This conference is aimed at finding a path to affordable and accessible wireless mm-wave and sub-THz experiments. The vision is of a versatile and affordable digital platform that can be used for a plethora of scientific experiments across many scientific disciplines. This conference is a first step towards fulfilling that vision. The conference will engage a broad swath of the research engineering community engaged in wireless research. Education and community outreach will be a primary focus of the conference. The organizers of the conference are committed to providing an inclusive environment for individuals from all backgrounds, including those from underrepresented communities in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental wireless research in the mm-wave and sub-THz today is conducted primarily by private companies as the instrumentation cost for such experiments is unaffordable for academic researchers in the research engineering community. This conference will point a path to solving this problem through accessible mmWave and sub-THz wireless experiments. The envisaged infrastructure will implement a scalable, versatile, programmable, and affordable digital platform that can be used for a plethora of scientific experiments across many scientific disciplines, including but not limited to communications, remote sensing, robotics, human computer interfaces, autonomy, networking, and sub-THz imaging. The long term vision is an infrastructure project that enables the deployment of an open-source portable device for use in research laboratories consisting of broadband mmWave transceivers, reconfigurable digital processors, and associated open-source programming kits. Deployment of a distributed testbed of such nodes will initiate experimental research in these emergent frequency bands at research laboratories across the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
