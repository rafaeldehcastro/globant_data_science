<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Current novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) diagnostic tests, used worldwide, take significant time, typically more than a day, to confirm results. There is an urgent need for a rapid coronavirus test platform throughout the world at this moment. This RAPID project will develop sensitive, fast and simple-to-use optical techniques to detect viral-RNA using Raman spectroscopy, which has capability for specific identification of COVID-19. The goal of this project is to design new material-based robust optical platform to detect trace level virus RNA. This will be accomplished by measuring the Raman signal from COVID-19 RNA. The expected outcome is a nanomaterial based technology underlying a portable device for accurate and immediate diagnosis of viral infections from COVID-19. The proposed research will enable approaches that mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on public health, society, and the economy. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant supports research with funding from the Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, with co-funding from the HBCU-EiR program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel material-based technologies for sensitive and rapid identification of COVID-19 is very important to tackle COVID-19 epidemic threat. The current project will contribute towards the development of novel mixed dimensional heterostructure based surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) platform for highly efficient and immediate fingerprint identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Specifically, the objectives include development of innovative 2D-0D, 1D-0D, and 2D-1D heterostructure building blocks and creating novel heterostructure-based SERS platform-based technology. The mixed-dimensional heterostructure material will offer opportunities for revolutionary advances in designing SERS platform. The SERS platform will provide accurate identification of the COVID-19 RNA, which can be used in both clinical and field settings. The RAPID program will serve as the bridge among scientific research, technological development, and educational activities for African American students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
