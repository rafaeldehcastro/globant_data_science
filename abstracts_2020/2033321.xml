<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Epidemics and pandemics emerge from human behavior and can similarly be mitigated by changing  human behavior.  Human behavioral changes are themselves shaped by social learning processes---how people come to know, remember, and believe---the consequences of violating recommended safety protocols.  This research project will use experimental methods to investigate how different information sharing strategies affect people’s learning about protocols to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and adherence to these protocols.  The project will test the relative effectiveness of curiosity inducement strategy (by presenting information in the form of a quiz rather than a direct statement) and peer information sharing strategies (asking message recipients to pass reliable COVID-related safety to several contacts) for social learning about the pandemic in different social context, thus allowing the results of the research to be applicable to broader environments.  Understanding which social communication strategy is more effective in promoting social learning about pandemics within different social contexts will allow policy makers to develop and implement more efficient communication strategies to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, and improve social learning generally.  The research results will help improve the health and economic well-being of American citizens as well as help establish the United States as the global leader in combating global pandemics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epidemics and pandemics emerge and are spread by human behavior; similarly, they are mitigated by human behavioral changes that come from social learning.  How do people learn—come to remember and believe—the potential consequences of violating recommended safety protocols? What factors influence whether, when, and how people behave differently when given new health-related knowledge?  This project will advance research on how alternative information-sharing strategies impact people’s learning of and adherence to public health protocols through three interrelated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to be conducted in different communities.  These RCTs test the effectiveness of two information-sharing techniques designed for delivery via text messages: curiosity inducement (achieved through presenting information in the form of a quiz rather than a direct statement) and peer information sharing (asking message recipients to pass reliable COVID-related safety information on to several contacts). The techniques share the goal of bringing COVID-19 related knowledge and behavior into line with safety protocols set by health authorities.  Conducting the RCTs across different communities allows the researchers to understand how social context affect the effectiveness of a particular mode of communication.  The results of this research has direct policy relevance to reducing the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition to helping to improve the health and economic well-being of Americans, this research project will also help establish the U.S. as the global leader in combating global pandemics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  At the outset, the most urgent questions of the Covid-19 pandemic belonged to epidemiologists. But as soon as experts named personal protective measures, new habits like social distancing and mask wearing, as pathways to mitigate disaster, the responsibility shifted to behavioral scientists. Our study asked: what if social networks, one of the powerful systems behind the spread of coronavirus misinformation, could be leveraged in a positive way, to amplify expert recommendations? And what if this could be done at low-cost, safely via technology already in the hands and pockets of people all over the world?  With the support of the National Science Foundation, we tested the effectiveness of peer-to-peer public health messages sent by SMS. The study took place in Zambia, a low-income country where mobile phones are prevalent and public health initiatives must be affordable to be viable.  We also used a small portion of the grant to run a similar study in Ghana. In the process, we collected data on economic conditions during the pandemic there and contributed to a study that combined data from developing countries to describe the impact of COVID-19. Because it represents a larger share of grant spending, we will focus on the Zambia SMS study here.  Study Design and Data Collection  The SMS study in Zambia was a collaboration with the Zambian Ministry of Health, the Zambian National Institute for Public Health, and the University of Zambia. Between February 5 and March 11, 2021 and May 19 and May 31, 2021, the Innovations for Poverty Action field team in Zambia implemented the study over two waves.  We built a sample of potential participants through cell phone numbers obtained via Random Digit Dialing. 3,027 of those we reached consented to the study and completed the baseline survey, becoming the sample we refer to as Random Digit Sample or RDS. At the end of the baseline survey, the field staff asked RDS participants to provide the contact information for up to five people they would be willing to forward study-related SMSs to; staff followed up with these contacts and those who consented became the 8,779 person Peer Participant sample.  The RDS participants were randomized into four treatment arms:  &#9679;      T0 or control: participants received SMSs sent using the short codes of a Zambian health authority but were not asked to forward the messages to the contacts they provided.  &#9679;      T1: participants received the same SMSs as T0 and were asked to forward the messages to the contacts they provided.  &#9679;      T2: participants received the same SMSs as the previous arms, were asked to forward them to contacts they provided, and were informed of a small cash incentive offered for each forwarded message.  &#9679;      T3: participants received the same SMSs as the previous treatment arms and were not asked to forward them. The contacts they provided received the same SMSs as participants in T1, T2, &amp; T3.  All RDS participants randomized into a treatment arm that received SMSs received separate messages about mask wearing, hand washing, and social distancing, as well as one that discouraged Covid stigma. Those who participated in the second wave received two additional messages encouraging vaccines.  Results   We found participants responded well to encouragement to spread public health information by SMS. We also found that cash incentives did not make people more likely to forward these messages. Goldberg et al. (2022) indicates cash incentives can work and work well in a different context, so differences between our study and Goldberg et al. may be key to understanding how and when to use cash for peer-to-peer public health initiatives.  Finally, using self-reported survey data, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the messages (whether peer-forwarded or not) had no impact on precautionary health behaviors.  Outcome of the Grant and Conclusions  Our study takes ideas validated in Goldberg et al. (2022) on tuberculosis in India and attempts to apply them to COVID-related health behaviors in Zambia. We find that peers are willing to participate in public health campaigns, but that incentives do not have any added effect. And, critically, using self-reported survey data, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect on health behaviors.
