<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This renewed three-year Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program, Interdisciplinary Research Experiences in Metrology &amp; Inspection, at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) will enhance the knowledge and skill-level of a diverse cohort of undergraduate students through empowering, hands-on and interdisciplinary research experiences in both traditional/advanced metrology and (destructive and non-destructive) inspection technologies. Metrology, the science of measurement, and inspection transcends scales, materials, and disciplines; yet, rarely are its salient aspects emphasized. This site is essentially a direct response to a specific concern raised by regional industry partners and technical workforce recruiters about the lack of pragmatic metrology/NDI-related knowledge and skills in their incoming workforce. The impact of this site will be to create empowered future researchers and a workforce well-rooted in metrology/inspection technologies, and motivate them to pursue advanced STEM degrees and careers; they will become the future pioneers in related STEM fields, and will help foster our nation's competitive advantages and thirst for innovative solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each summer, 10 students will be hosted at TAMU, where they will be immersed in hands-on research experiences comprised of a state-of-the-art research project, technical sessions/seminars, lab practice, field tours, and professional-development workshops. This experience will also serve the TAMU upper-level undergraduates and graduate students with invaluable team and personnel management experience. This site will advance scientific knowledge through inter-disciplinary research projects, and help further the field especially in regard to the energy and manufacturing sectors. Five vertically-integrated teams, each comprising two REU students, one senior undergraduate and one graduate student (from TAMU) and a faculty mentor, will work in concert on select research projects over 10 summer-weeks. This on-site experience will be supplemented with follow-ups for continued interaction, growth, and guidance for pursuing advanced study. Student deliverables include public dissemination of research results, and a follow-up plan tailored to each student's career interests. The impact of this site will be to excite, empower, and educate students, and to enable/inspire them to pursue advanced study and STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
