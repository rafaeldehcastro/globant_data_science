<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is to promote environmentally sustainable construction.  By promoting the use of bamboo in construction industry via offering a sustainable alternative to 3D printed concrete, this project intends to reduce industry's contribution towards future carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Current trends show that 3D printing could replace a large share of construction industry due to high efficiency, low labor, and reduced material requirements. This project would speed that transition with its sustainable alternative to concrete. Since bamboo can absorb as much as 12 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare per year, compared to 6.4 tons for a mature forest, broader use of bamboo in the construction industry benefits the environment. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project is focused on creating a structural bamboo filament that could replace 3D printer filaments made of concrete. This project will use bamboo for a rival filament to concrete to be used in structural applications. Non-structural wood filaments already exist and are mixed with Polylactic-Acid (PLA). This project plans to incorporate some of those techniques in its design by breaking the bamboo into rectangular, dust-like particles for combination with a soy-based adhesive and PLA. The most challenging problems anticipated in this project are optimizing that glue ratio to maximize spread properties and ultimate strength, and orienting the anisotropic bamboo particles during the deposition. The project aims to produce a bamboo filament that maintains similar properties to concrete filaments in terms of strength and durability by the end of Phase I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The second point of fast printing is important because our speed is 4-5 faster than current market competitors. This saves tremendous amounts of time and money. The third point is something that is not only underutilized in 3D printing, but all concrete. Concrete is one of the most carbon intensive materials on the planet and we are actively working to reduce its impact, while maintaining cost and strength. The fourth point is one that nobody in the world has seemed to demonstrate, by adding large aggregate, we can more than double the strength of the mortar and 3D printing can then fully compete with traditional construction materials. The final point of printing rebar is similar to the fourth point, in terms of competing not only with other printing companies, but other traditional construction methods. By printing rebar, we remove the need for any labor to lay formwork or rebar in the structure, which requires skill and a lot of time.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our final goal, and one that we should achieve and commercialize with Phase 2 funding, is to be able to pull up to a job site in our pick up truck, have our arm deploy from the bed of the truck, and begin printing immediately. It will then print the entire structure with little input from skilled laborers, this includes printing walls, floors, roofs, etc.&nbsp; We can print free floating floors (2nd story and above) utilizing our rebar printing technology. This whole process cuts down waste, time, and cost; all while providing the strongest, most sustainable, and most affordable structure on the market.
