<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation on R/V Atlantis, a 274-foot general purpose research vessel, and R/V Armstrong, a 238-foot multidisciplinary vessel. Both are operated by WHOI as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF) which is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). Both are owned by the U.S. Navy, have state-of-the-art instrumentation and support all disciplines of oceanographic research.  The vessels work in all the world’s oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies. R/V Atlantis is specifically outfitted for launching and servicing Alvin, the human occupied submersible as well as other vehicles of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2019, R/V Atlantis completed 284 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 90% of the total sailing schedule (254 days). In 2020, Atlantis is scheduled for 138 days with NSF accounting for 72 of those or 52%.  R/V Armstrong sailed 217 total days in 2019 and 43 of these, 20%, were for NSF. Additionally, 78 days (36%) were for NSF-OOI. The vessel is scheduled for 295 days in 2020, 25% of which (59 days) are for NSF and 33% (79 days) are for NSF OOI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this proposal, WHOI provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Hidex 300SL automatic LSC  $128,175&lt;br/&gt;(3) McLane Submersible Bio Pumps $122,475&lt;br/&gt;(1) DAVPR Battery Case  $6,406&lt;br/&gt;(2) EK80 portable calibration systems $5,992&lt;br/&gt;      $263,048&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
