<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Phosphorous is an important nutrient sustaining all forms of life. In particular, in the ocean, phosphorous is a key limiting nutrient, controlling levels of primary productivity across large swaths of the ocean. Removal of phosphorous occurs largely via formation of stable apatite minerals in ocean sediments. However, average ocean conditions generally inhibit the formation of apatite, thus the abundance of apatite minerals in marine sediments is a mystery. This research aims to determine the mechanisms of apatite formation in the ocean to answer this century-old question. Evaluating these mechanisms will greatly advance current understanding of phosphorous cycling in the ocean. A more detailed understanding of phosphorous cycling can be applied across the disciplines of ocean science, and because of the importance of phosphorous as a nutrient and an element with a variety of interactions with other elements, it will be applicable to a variety of other research questions. The researchers are dedicated to promoting diversity in ocean science and plan to include undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the study. They will also mentor a postdoc and communicate their science to the public and K-12 teachers via a blog entitled ?Britannica Blog?, the Atlanta Science Festival, a rock show, and educational material, the latter two to be developed as part of this work.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marine phosphorous burial via authigenic stable apatite formation in sediments is a major pathway for phosphorous removal in the ocean. However, in most marine environments, under natural conditions, this process is kinetically inhibited. It has been a mystery for more than a century as to how it is therefore possible for apatite to be oversaturated in large areas of marine sediments. A possible mechanism that could explain 95% of the apatite burial flux is that apatite minerals are precipitated as fine-grained particles from exogenous polyphosphate intermediates. Exogenous polyphosphates have been understudied, despite this possible importance as a mechanism for phosphorous removal. As a consequence this research could revolutionize current understanding of phosphorous cycling in the ocean for the major aim is to make a thorough and detailed study of the mechanisms behind marine apatite formation, focusing on the role of exogenous polyphosphate particles. Phosphorous is an element with widespread importance in ocean sciences, and more clearly understanding its burial will have applications across the disciplines.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The chemical element phosphorus (P) is a vital building block for all forms of life.  In the ocean, P is present in many dissolved, organic, and inorganic forms that are biologically useable.  Yet under certain conditions, these nutritional forms of P transform into calcium-phosphate (Ca-P) mineral particles that are biologically unusable.  The formation of these Ca-P minerals has consequences for marine productivity, atmospheric CO2 uptake by the ocean, and therefore climate.  However, the processes controlling the natural formation of marine Ca-P minerals are poorly understood.  One hypothesis has suggested that the P-rich molecule polyphosphate plays a key role in Ca-P mineral formation.  Therefore, the goal of this project was to determine how polyphosphate could lead to Ca-P mineral formation in the marine environment.  Polyphosphate is a polymer of at least three phosphate ions that is produced by every cell in nature, and it is ubiquitous in marine microorganisms, seawater, and sediments.  Results from this project show that representative marine microorganisms can use polyphosphate as a source of P to support their growth.  To do so, they produce common enzymes that efficiently degrade polyphosphate into phosphate.  We found that polyphosphate degradation by these enzymes can lead to Ca-P mineral formation.  In addition, we discovered that common mineral particles rich in iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), or aluminum (Al) could degrade polyphosphate as well, which also led to Ca-P mineral formation.  Overall, this project has uncovered previously unknown processes of polyphosphate cycling and Ca-P mineral formation in the marine environment, which improves our understanding of fundamental factors that control marine productivity, atmospheric CO2 uptake by the ocean, and therefore climate.  This project has provided educational and professional development opportunities for two junior female principal investigators, a postdoc, PhD students, and undergraduate student researchers from diverse backgrounds.  We have shared results from this work in graduate and undergraduate courses at Georgia Tech, the University of Georgia Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, and UC San Diego Scripps Oceanography.  This project has also provided opportunities for engaging with K-12 educational groups and the general public on the importance of the marine P cycle.  P is a critical and dwindling natural resource necessary for sustaining global food supply, yet it is used wastefully, which contributes to aquatic nutrient pollution and harmful algal blooms.  In this context, the findings from this project also have potential value toward the development of more sustainable practices for the management and use of P.
