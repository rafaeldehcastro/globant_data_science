<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The International Mind, Brain, and Education Society (IMBES) conference aims to facilitate cross-cultural collaboration across the cognitive, educational, developmental and neural sciences. The biennial IMBES meeting is a unique opportunity for scholars and educators to come together to engage in reciprocal dialogue about research and practice. Researchers investigating learning processes have the opportunity to share the results of their work with educators and receive feedback on the translational opportunities for the research. In turn, educators can update their understanding of the cognitive, developmental and neural bases of learning and share their knowledge of efficacious techniques, tools, and classroom practices with researchers. IMBES has now formed a partnership with the EARLI SIG 22, and they plan to meet jointly in 2021 and in 2022. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a leading venue for building the science of learning, the 2021 IMBES conference includes the following objectives: (1) To build diversity in the attendees with travel fellowship; (2) To build diversity with a symposium addressing diversity in the science of learning; (3) To facilitate formation of a Global Science of Learning Network with travel fellowships to attend a pre-conference meeting. Conference abstracts and poster presentations will be available on the IMBES website (www.imbes.org) after the conference and selected papers will invited from the conference for peer review for possible publication in a special issue of the societyâ€™s journal, Mind, Brain and Education. To the extent possible, key sessions at the conference will be live-streamed and/or video-recorded for audiences who are unable to attend, including classroom teachers, educational administrators and policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
