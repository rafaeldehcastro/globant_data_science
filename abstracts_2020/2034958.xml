<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quantum Internet has the potential to transform the way that we understand and interact with the world around us. The anticipated research infrastructure would accelerate the development of the Quantum Internet, impacting research at a national scale. This infrastructure would benefit academic institutions, national laboratories, and commercial enterprises. This facility would enable large and small corporations to develop new quantum products and expertise on Quantum Internet technologies. The proposed workshop will encourage multi-disciplinary collaboration by including speakers from integrated photonics, optical communications, and optical sensing. The organizers of the conference are committed to providing an inclusive environment for individuals of all backgrounds, including those from underrepresented communities in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference would be aimed at developing the knowledge base necessary to establish engineering research infrastructure for the science, engineering and technology of quantum photonics. This facility would provide an unparalleled environment for research and education on Quantum Internet technologies, and have the potential to spark entrepreneurship. Quantum Internet infrastructure would be a proving ground for major new quantum photonic technologies with tools and services that will enable researchers to evolve their innovations from ideas to real world, market transforming products. National laboratories and government institutions could also rely on the facility to understand and develop the quantum internet for the security and economic benefit of our nation. The objectives in organizing this conference are to: 1) develop a clear vision for the development of a national facility, 2) establish national needs and priority areas, 3) create a framework for the facility capabilities and operations, 4) organize the community of stakeholders around the facility vision, 5) develop a plan for the community to move forward with development of a midscale infrastructure proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A workshop was held online on August 13 &amp; 14, 2020, sponsored by the National Science Foundation and managed by the Optical Society. Additional input was provided by follow up working group meetings held between September 2020 and December 2020. A major outcome of this workshop was a proposal submitted to the NSF call for midscale infrastructure, RI-1 Design phase in order to complete additional prototyping and design work to develop a plan for the larger RI-2 infrastructure project that would fulfill the vision developed in this workshop.  The workshop and related meetings developed a vision for a quantum internet research facility that would lay the groundwork for developing a national scale quantum Internet. This facility would enable researchers to investigate and develop each of the building blocks for a national scale network and help to support the roll out of such a network in the future. This facility is analogous to the Gigabit Testbeds that laid the groundwork for the the fiber optic internet that we use today.  Participants identified the need for a quantum internet research facility along seven different dimensions. Importantly, it was recognized that there is a growing community of potential 'users' for such a facility who would not have the expertise or capacity to build the infrastructure, but would use it to develop new quantum internet technologies and the lack of infrastructure is currently a barrier.
