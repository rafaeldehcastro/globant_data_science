<AbstractNarration>This archaeological research examines the decisions and strategies employed by Native individuals and communities in the context of changing colonial relations during the early 19th century in California. Archaeology is well positioned to evaluate this issue because its emphasis on space, time, and objects allows for the reconstruction of how past social agents navigated significant shifts in colonial strategies over time. This is particularly important considering the broadscale social and economic shifts that occurred during the Mission period. While the initial goal of the mission system was to convert local peoples into loyal Spanish subjects, new policies helped free mission laborers from Franciscan rule. The assessment of materials deposited within earlier and later Mission contexts can thus not only provide new insights into the operation of colonialism but can also be used to ascertain the political strategies and daily practices employed by Native groups during these distinct periods in time. These data can be used as a comparative to other regions throughout California, and even across the globe, to understand the differing impacts of colonial policies on indigenous populations and the way that local groups navigated colonialism using their own system of meanings and values. The research will be conducted with the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians and California State Parks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given this broader context, this project undertakes research to study the social organization of one Native community within a mission setting and evaluate how they responded to the retreat of the Spanish frontier inside the mission space. The study of indigenous experiences at Mission La Purísima Concepcíon offers an ideal lens through which to investigate these issues because two distinct stratigraphic/ chronological groups have been previously identified. By exploring labor practices, foodways, craft industries, and trade and exchange from these two distinct contexts, this project sheds light on how the Chumash community at the Mission navigated new colonial policies and relations over time. These results are used to understand evolving indigenous social identities at the community level and regional scale given the broader historical background of sea change happening in Alta California under colonialism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project drew on multiple lines of archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence to demonstrate a richly complex understanding of Chumash life entangled with broader colonial structures and linked to a deeper ancestral past at Mission La Purisima Concepci&oacute;n located in Lompoc, California during the early nineteenth century. Using a fine-grained analysis of museum collections integrated with recent field work, the archaeological record reveals how the community of ’Amuwu maintained connections to ancestral locations on the landscape and hinterland communities. However, there are distinct patterns in the mission that suggests a cultural transformation occurred as well. Compared to other Chumash villages occupied during the Historic period in the Santa Ynez Valley and Puriseme&ntilde;o territory, and more broadly across the Chumash homeland, the material signature left behind by individuals at ’Amuwu speaks to a reorganizational strategy linked to both Spanish and Mexican colonialism. Distinct chronological and spatial contexts within the Native rancheria at the mission exemplify how the community re-organized, transformed, and evolved in tandem with broader colonial structures, but nonetheless stayed true to ancestral practices.  The results lend important insight into arguments for and limitations of schools of continuity and transformation, specifically as it relates to Native-lived experiences in the mission and the effects of sustained face-to-face interactions following relocation programs and broader colonial policies.

The becoming of ’Amuwu was tied to the creation of new identities linked to the construction of a new place in a colonial setting nestled within a long history of internal understandings of cultural knowledge and community.  From here, we have a better grasp on identity issues in mission contexts in California that can help move forward conversations of persistence and chance, which continue to reverberate in the present day.
