<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[People encounter a variety of syntactic structures in everyday language use, whether through reading or spoken conversation. In some cases, sentences can be ambiguous and have more than one meaning. For example, in "The spy saw the man with the binoculars", one interpretation is that the spy is looking through the binoculars, while an alternative interpretation is that the man has the binoculars. Yet, despite this ambiguity, people are still able to converge on a single interpretation. The mechanisms behind this are still debated today as many factors have been shown to guide comprehension. This dissertation project will investigate how experience with an unfamiliar structure affects language processing. Experience is thought to play a large role in comprehension, however, despite its large role in theoretical models, there is still no direct evidence of whether people actually keep track of distribution i.e., the relative frequency of a target structure and competing structures. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;This doctoral dissertation project investigates whether people can implicitly acquire syntactic distributional information by directly manipulating the relative frequency of syntactic structures while holding overall exposure constant: the probability of an unfamiliar, dialectal structure ("The meal needs cooked", a variation of "The meal needs to be cooked") relative to another competing structure ("The meal needs cooked vegetables"). The dialectal structure is mainly associated with a dialect from Western Pennsylvania, and is unfamiliar to most people outside of this region. In a series of experiments, self-paced reading is used to test whether a higher proportion of the dialectal structure leads to less processing difficulty over time. The investigators also test whether the distributional information from the verb "needs" can be generalized to a related verb (i.e. "wants"). This project will inform theories of language learning as it provides a stronger test of distributional learning compared to previous studies. It also seeks to have practical implications for optimum learning strategies for grammar and reading comprehension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Several current theories propose that humans are sensitive to the statistical patterns of language, and that this guides sentence processing. This project focused on the frequency of syntactic structures and its effect on syntactic processing and tested the hypothesis that people can implicitly acquire syntactic frequency information. This idea is suggested by current models of sentence processing, but the specifics of what statistics people are sensitive to is still unclear and has not been directly tested.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We directly manipulated the frequency statistics of two different competing syntactic structures: the dialectal needs structure and the modifier structure (Table 1). The dialectal structure is from a dialect mainly associated with Western Pennsylvania, and is unfamiliar to most people. We used a self-paced reading task to test comprehension difficulty during the ambiguous word in these sentences (i.e. &ldquo;before&rdquo;). Participants<strong> </strong>read sentences in a moving window display one word at a time at their own pace. Upcoming and previous words were masked by blank lines while only the current word was revealed, and participants pressed the spacebar to advance to the next word. After reaching the end of the sentence, participants answered one comprehension question to ensure they read the sentence. Within each experiment, the relative<strong> </strong>frequency of the dialectal needs structure was manipulated e.g. the probability of that structure occurring relative to alternatives, such as the modifier structure, while keeping the raw<strong> </strong>frequency constant e.g. the exposure of a structure independent of the frequency of competing structures.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across three experiments, the relative frequency of the dialectal needs structure was manipulated. In the first experiment, we found that the proportion of dialectal structures affected reading rate; participants who received a higher proportion of dialectal structures (80% of sentences) relative to the modifier structure (20%) read the ambiguous word faster over time compared to participants who received a lower proportion of the dialectal sentences (40%). Critically, the raw frequency of the dialectal sentences was kept constant across both conditions, indicating that the change in relative frequency led to this difference. However, our results from the second experiment show that this sensitivity is not fine-grained; there was no difference in results when 90% or 66% of the sentences were dialectal, suggesting that participants may only be keeping track of the more frequent alternative syntactic structure. In a third experiment, we found that when examining whether participants could generalize to a dialectal structure with a different verb (e.g. &ldquo;The dog wants washed&rdquo;) after exposure to the dialectal needs sentences, the relative frequency information did not transfer across different verbs, despite occurring in the same structure. Altogether, this project provides direct evidence of the role of relative frequency on sentence processing, in addition to its limitations.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project also included an additional fourth experiment, which tested the role of raw frequency independently of relative frequency. We found that giving participants more dialectal sentences led to faster reading times compared to fewer dialectal sentences, while controlling for relative frequency. Furthermore, the effect of raw frequency was larger than the effect of relative frequency found in the first experiment. This suggests that raw frequency may play a larger role in syntactic processing compared to the relative frequency between competing structures.
