<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Sexual selection is a major driver of evolution, often resulting in drastically different characteristics between males and females. Recently it has become clear that gene duplication is also a powerful contributor to evolutionary diversification. This research seeks to understand how young gene duplicates evolve sex-specific essential functions under sexually antagonistic selection. Males and females, while sharing most of their DNA, satisfy different functional requirements for reproduction and survival. Sexual selection on traits with a shared genetic basis can have opposing effects in the two sexes, causing sexual conflict (SC) that may reduce fitness until the conflict is resolved by new genetic changes. This project addresses the hypothesis that gene duplication is an effective mechanism to resolve sexual conflict, using the fruit fly as a convenient model organism. In pursuing these aims, postdocs, graduates, undergraduates and high school students will be trained in molecular and evolutionary biology. The project will also partner with the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy to involve diverse high school students in the research through lectures and summer internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on a pair of recently duplicated genes (Apl and Arts) in Drosophila that have opposing fitness effects in the two sexes. The functional evolution in the protein sequences will be characterized to understand the role of protein divergence in mitigation of sexual conflict. The ancestral gene from which Apl and Arts were derived will then be computationally reconstructed and experimentally synthesized. A series of engineered Drosophila strains will then be created using gene editing technology, with different versions of the synthesized ancestral gene replacing the wildtype gene locus which harbors Apl and Arts. Divergence in expression of constructs with different regulatory regions will reveal their role in mitigating sexual conflict. The generality of the duplication-mediated SC resolution model will be tested by examining a score of recent gene duplicates with sex complementary expression patterns using gene knockout and rescue analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the third year, we have detected the fitness effects of the single copy authologue of Apl-Arts in two ancestral stages in the single species lineage of D. melanogaster.  At ancestral stage 1, the single copy in the speciation to form D. melanogatser, we replaced the Apl-Art genomic region of D. melanogaster with the single copy authologue, GE19865, in the closely related species of D. yakuba. Then we detected fitness by homoginizing the replacement line.  We detected a surprising result: we observed that all D. melanogaster flies with the D. yakuba ortholog in place of Apl and Arts were unable to produce offspring and are likely sterile.   At ancestral stage 2, the single copy stage before the tandem dupliucation to form Apl and Arts, we deleted the whole tandem duplicatioin stage by using the CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR).  We also detected an interesting effect of the loss of the genomic region: the fitness is remarkablly dropped but not steril.    We have created more accurate ancestral lines by replacing the Alp-Arts genomic region with the synthesized ancestral sequences for stages 1 and 2 we had inferred in our grant proposal.  We are analyzing their fitness effects in comparison with the approximate results above.  D. yakuba is closely related with D. melanogaster with divergence time of 4-6 Million years. We hypothesized that its sequences is highly similar to the ancestral orthologous gene in D. melanogaster and its sibling D. simulans.   This year, we have completed what we planed in our research plan in Objectives 1 and 2: to create ancestral gene lines and detect their fitness effects.    In addition, we recently have made  a new also surprising discovers for Objective 3, Test the generality of SC-driven new gene evolution by detecting fitness effects of Alp/Arts-unrelated duplicates using CRISPR analysis. Using soma and germ-conditional knockdowns, we detected the sex-specific fertility effects in male and female.  We found that the soma and germs showed opposite effects. The knockdown of soma-expressed new genes more often led to reduced female fertlity and increasing male fertility, compared to control. This suggests that the type of wildtype new genes are advantageous for females and detrimental for males (M-F+), in constrast to the prediction of the Darwin-Bateman Paradigm of sexual selection.  On the other hand, the knockdown of germ-expressed new genes (mostly testis-biased) more often detected reduced effects of male ferlity and enhanced female fertility.  This suggests that the type of wildtype new genes are male advantageous and female detrimental (M+F-), consistent with the sexual selective prediction of Darwin and Bateman.  The novelty in these observation is that the sexual selection may also occur in females but on soma traits.  In the same individuals, soma and germ are also in conflict.  These are a conceptial progress we achieved in this project.  From next year, we will publish above results and the results we found in the entire project. We have started to write research articles.  I upload a figure to summarize the technical procedure and the lines with ancestral genes we have created and analyzed.
